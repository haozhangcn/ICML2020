  David Rolnick, Konrad Kording [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1-Supplemental.zip)
> <p>It has been widely assumed that a neural network cannot be recovered from its outputs, as the  network depends on its parameters in a highly nonlinear way. Here, we prove that in fact it is often possible to identify the architecture, weights, and biases of an unknown deep ReLU network by observing only its output. Every ReLU network defines a piecewise linear function, where the boundaries between linear regions correspond to inputs for which some neuron in the network switches between inactive and active ReLU states. By dissecting the set of region boundaries into components associated with particular neurons, we show both theoretically and empirically that it is possible to recover the weights of neurons and their arrangement within the network, up to isomorphism.</p>

> <p>Consider N cooperative but non-communicating players where each plays one out of M arms for T turns. Players have different utilities for each arm, representable as an NxM matrix. However, these utilities are unknown to the players. In each turn players receive noisy observations of their utility for their selected arm. However, if any other players selected the same arm that turn, they will all receive zero utility due to the conflict. No other communication or coordination between the players is possible. Our goal is to design a distributed algorithm that learns the matching between players and arms that achieves max-min fairness while minimizing the regret. We present an algorithm and prove that it is regret optimal up to a log(log T) factor. This is the first max-min fairness multi-player bandit algorithm with (near) order optimal regret. </p> 
### 3.[Scalable Differentiable Physics for Learning and Control](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3243.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/15-Paper.pdf)
  Yi-Ling Qiao, Junbang Liang, Vladlen Koltun, Ming Lin [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/15-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/15-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Differentiable physics is a powerful approach to learning and control problems that involve physical objects and environments. While notable progress has been made, the capabilities of differentiable physics solvers remain limited. We develop a scalable framework for differentiable physics that can support a large number of objects and their interactions. To accommodate objects with arbitrary geometry and topology, we adopt meshes as our representation and leverage the sparsity of contacts for scalable differentiable collision handling. Collisions are resolved in localized regions to minimize the number of optimization variables even when the number of simulated objects is high. We further accelerate implicit differentiation of optimization with nonlinear constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the presented framework requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory and computation in comparison to recent particle-based methods. We further validate the approach on inverse problems and control scenarios, where it outperforms derivative-free and model-free baselines by at least an order of magnitude.</p> 
### 4.[Generalization to New Actions in Reinforcement Learning](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3244.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/29-Paper.pdf)
  Ayush Jain, Andrew Szot, Joseph Lim [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/29-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/29-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>A fundamental trait of intelligence is the ability to achieve goals in the face of novel circumstances. However, standard reinforcement learning typically assumes a fixed set of actions to choose from. Completing tasks with a new action space then requires time-consuming retraining. The ability to seamlessly utilize novel actions is crucial for adaptable agents. We take a step in this direction by introducing the problem of learning to generalize decision-making to unseen actions, based on action information acquired separately from the task. To approach this problem, we propose a two-stage framework where the agent first infers action representations from acquired action observations and then learns to use these in reinforcement learning with added generalization objectives. We demonstrate that our framework enables zero-shot generalization to new actions in sequential decision-making tasks, such as selecting unseen tools to solve physical reasoning puzzles and stacking towers with novel 3D shapes.</p> 
### 5.[Randomized Block-Diagonal Preconditioning for Parallel Learning](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3245.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/53-Paper.pdf)
  Celestine Mendler-DÃ¼nner, Aurelien Lucchi [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/53-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/53-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>We study preconditioned gradient-based optimization methods where the preconditioning matrix has block-diagonal form. Such a structural constraint comes with the advantage that the update computation can be parallelized across multiple independent tasks. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that the convergence of these methods can significantly be improved by a randomization technique which corresponds to repartitioning coordinates across tasks during the optimization procedure. We provide a theoretical analysis that accurately characterizes the expected convergence gains of repartitioning and validate our findings empirically on various traditional machine learning tasks. From an implementation perspective, block-separable models are well suited for parallelization and, when shared memory is available, randomization can be implemented on top of existing methods very efficiently to improve convergence.</p> 
### 6.[Stochastic Flows and Geometric Optimization on the Orthogonal Group](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3246.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/57-Paper.pdf)
  Krzysztof Choromanski, David Cheikhi, Jared Davis, Valerii Likhosherstov, Achille Nazaret, Achraf Bahamou, Xingyou Song, Mrugank Akarte, Jack Parker-Holder, Jacob Bergquist, YUAN GAO, Aldo Pacchiano, Tamas Sarlos, Adrian Weller, Vikas Sindhwani [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/57-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/57-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>We present a new class of stochastic, geometrically-driven optimization algorithms on the orthogonal group O(d) and naturally reductive homogeneous manifolds obtained from the action of the rotation group SO(d). We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that our methods can be applied in various fields of machine learning including deep, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning, normalizing flows and metric learning. We show an intriguing connection between efficient stochastic optimization on the orthogonal group and graph theory (e.g. matching problem, partition functions over graphs, graph-coloring). We leverage the theory of Lie groups and provide theoretical results for the designed class of algorithms. We demonstrate broad applicability of our methods by showing strong performance on the seemingly unrelated tasks of learning world models to obtain stable policies for the most difficult Humanoid agent from OpenAI Gym and improving convolutional neural networks.</p> 
### 7.[PackIt: A Virtual Environment for Geometric Planning](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3247.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/62-Paper.pdf)
  Ankit Goyal, Jia Deng [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/62-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/62-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>The ability to jointly understand the geometry of objects and plan actions for manipulating them is crucial for intelligent agents. We refer to this ability as geometric planning. Recently, many interactive environments have been proposed to evaluate intelligent agents on various skills, however, none of them cater to the needs of geometric planning. We present PackIt, a virtual environment to evaluate and potentially learn the ability to do geometric planning. In this environment, an agent needs to take a sequence of actions to pack a set of objects into a box with limited space. We also construct a set of challenging packing tasks using an evolutionary algorithm. Further, we study various baselines for the task that include model-free learning-based and heuristic-based methods, as well as search-based optimization methods that assume access to the model of the environment.</p> 
### 8.[Soft Threshold Weight Reparameterization for Learnable Sparsity](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3248.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/67-Paper.pdf)
  Aditya Kusupati, Vivek Ramanujan, Raghav Somani, Mitchell Wortsman, Prateek Jain, Sham Kakade, Ali Farhadi [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/67-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/67-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is studied extensively with the focus of maximizing prediction accuracy given an overall parameter budget. Existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic non-uniform sparsity budgets which have sub-optimal layer-wise parameter allocation resulting in a) lower prediction accuracy or b) higher inference cost (FLOPs). This work proposes Soft Threshold Reparameterization (STR), a novel use of the soft-threshold operator on DNN weights. STR smoothly induces sparsity while learning pruning thresholds thereby obtaining a non-uniform sparsity budget. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for unstructured sparsity in CNNs (ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), and, additionally, learns non-uniform budgets that empirically reduce the FLOPs by up to 50%. Notably, STR boosts the accuracy over existing results by up to 10% in the ultra sparse (99%) regime and can also be used to induce low-rank (structured sparsity) in RNNs. In short, STR is a simple mechanism which learns effective sparsity budgets that contrast with popular heuristics. Code, pretrained models and sparsity budgets are at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/STR.</p> 
### 9.[Stochastic Latent Residual Video Prediction](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3249.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/78-Paper.pdf)
  Jean-Yves Franceschi, Edouard Delasalles, Mickael Chen, Sylvain Lamprier, Patrick Gallinari [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/78-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/78-Supplemental.zip)
> <p>Designing video prediction models that account for the inherent uncertainty of the future is challenging. Most works in the literature are based on stochastic image-autoregressive recurrent networks, which raises several performance and applicability issues. An alternative is to use fully latent temporal models which untie frame synthesis and temporal dynamics. However, no such model for stochastic video prediction has been proposed in the literature yet, due to design and training difficulties. In this paper, we overcome these difficulties by introducing a novel stochastic temporal model whose dynamics are governed in a latent space by a residual update rule. This first-order scheme is motivated by discretization schemes of differential equations. It naturally models video dynamics as it allows our simpler, more interpretable, latent model to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.</p> 
### 10.[Fractional Underdamped Langevin Dynamics: Retargeting SGD with Momentum under Heavy-Tailed Gradient Noise](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3250.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/86-Paper.pdf)
  Umut Simsekli, Lingjiong Zhu, Yee Whye Teh, Mert Gurbuzbalaban [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/86-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/86-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDm) is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. While there is a rich theory of SGDm for convex problems, the theory is considerably less developed in the context of deep learning where the  problem is non-convex and the gradient noise might exhibit a heavy-tailed behavior, as empirically observed in recent studies. In this study, we consider a \emph{continuous-time} variant of SGDm, known as the underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD), and investigate its asymptotic properties under heavy-tailed perturbations. Supported by recent studies from statistical physics, we argue both theoretically and empirically that the heavy-tails of such perturbations can result in a bias even when the step-size is small, in the sense that \emph{the optima of stationary distribution} of the dynamics might not match \emph{the optima of the cost function to be optimized}. As a remedy, we develop a novel framework, which we coin as \emph{fractional} ULD (FULD), and prove that FULD targets the so-called Gibbs distribution, whose optima exactly match the optima of the original cost. We observe that the Euler discretizatin of FULD has noteworthy algorithmic similarities with \emph{natural gradient} methods and \emph{gradient clipping}, bringing a new perspective on understanding their role in deep learning. We support our theory with experiments conducted on a synthetic model and neural networks.</p> 
### 11.[Context Aware Local Differential Privacy](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3251.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/111-Paper.pdf)
  Jayadev Acharya, Keith Bonawitz, Peter Kairouz, Daniel  Ramage, Ziteng Sun [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/111-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/111-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Local differential privacy (LDP) is a strong notion of privacy that often leads to a significant drop in utility. The original definition of LDP assumes that all the elements in the data domain are equally sensitive. However, in many real-life applications, some elements are more sensitive than others. We propose a context-aware framework for LDP that allows the privacy level to vary across the data domain, enabling system designers to place privacy constraints where they matter without paying the cost where they do not. For binary data domains, we provide a universally optimal privatization scheme and highlight its connections to Warnerâs randomized response and Mangatâs improved response. Motivated by geo-location and web search applications, for k-ary data domains, we consider two special cases of context-aware LDP: block-structured LDP and high-low LDP. We study minimax discrete distribution estimation under both cases and provide communication-efficient, sample-optimal schemes, and information-theoretic lower bounds. We show, using worst-case analyses and experiments on Gowallaâs 3.6 million check-ins to 43,750 locations, that context-aware LDP achieves a far better accuracy under the same number of samples.</p> 
### 12.[Privately Learning Markov Random Fields](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3252.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/112-Paper.pdf)
  Gautam Kamath, Janardhan Kulkarni, Steven Wu, Huanyu Zhang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/112-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/112-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>We consider the problem of learning Markov Random Fields (including   the prototypical example, the Ising model) under the constraint of   differential privacy.  Our learning goals include both   \emph{structure learning}, where we try to estimate the underlying   graph structure of the model, as well as the harder goal of   \emph{parameter learning}, in which we additionally estimate the   parameter on each edge.  We provide algorithms and lower bounds for   both problems under a variety of privacy constraints --   namely pure, concentrated, and approximate differential privacy.   While non-privately, both learning goals enjoy roughly the same   complexity, we show that this is not the case under differential   privacy.  In particular, only structure learning under approximate   differential privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic   dependence on the dimensionality of the data, while a change in   either the learning goal or the privacy notion would necessitate a   polynomial dependence. As a result, we show that the privacy     constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning     problems in the high-dimensional data regime.</p> 
### 13.[A Mean Field Analysis Of Deep ResNet And Beyond: Towards  Provably Optimization Via Overparameterization From Depth](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3253.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/115-Paper.pdf)
  Yiping Lu, Chao Ma, Yulong Lu, Jianfeng Lu, Lexing Ying [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/115-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/115-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Training deep neural networks with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can often achieve zero training loss on real-world tasks although the optimization landscape is known to be highly non-convex. To understand the success of SGD for training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-field analysis of deep residual networks, based on a line of works which interpret the continuum limit of the deep residual network as an ordinary differential equation as the the network capacity tends to infinity. Specifically, we propose a \textbf{new continuum limit} of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in the sense that \textbf{every local minimizer is global}.  This characterization enables us to derive the first global convergence result for multilayer neural networks in the mean-field regime. Furthermore, our proof does not rely on the convexity of the loss landscape, but instead, an assumption on the global minimizer should achieve zero loss which can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property. Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles a shallow network ensemble~\cite{veit2016residual}, \emph{i.e.} a two-layer network. We bound the difference between the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivity method, which enables us to transfer previous mean-field analysis of two-layer networks to deep networks. Furthermore, we propose several novel training schemes based on our new continuous model, among which one new training procedure introduces the operation of switching the order of the residual blocks and results in strong empirical performance on benchmark datasets. </p> 
### 14.Provable Smoothness Guarantees for Black-Box Variational Inference [:chains:](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3254.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/120-Paper.pdf)
  Justin Domke [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/120-Metadata.json)
> <p>Black-box variational inference tries to approximate a complex target distribution through a gradient-based optimization of the parameters of a simpler distribution. Provable convergence guarantees require structural properties of the objective. This paper shows that for location-scale family approximations, if the target is M-Lipschitz smooth, then so is the âenergyâ part of the variational objective. The key proof idea is to describe gradients in a certain inner-product space, thus permitting the use of Besselâs inequality. This result gives bounds on the location of the optimal parameters, and is a key ingredient for convergence guarantees.</p> 
### 15.[Enhancing Simple Models by Exploiting What They Already Know](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3255.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/126-Paper.pdf)
  Amit Dhurandhar, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Ronny Luss [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/126-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/126-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model of much lower complexity such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance. Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel. Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method. The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases. In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance. We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works. Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model.</p> 
### 16.[Fiduciary Bandits](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3256.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/127-Paper.pdf)
  Gal Bahar, Omer Ben-Porat, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Moshe Tennenholtz [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/127-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/127-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Recommendation systems often face exploration-exploitation tradeoffs: the system can only learn about the desirability of new options by recommending them to some user. Such systems can thus be modeled as multi-armed bandit settings; however, users are self-interested and cannot be made to follow recommendations. We ask whether exploration can nevertheless be performed in a way that scrupulously respects agents' interests---i.e., by a system that acts as a \emph{fiduciary}.  More formally, we introduce a  model  in  which  a recommendation system faces an exploration-exploitation tradeoff under the constraint that it can never recommend any action that it knows  yields lower reward in expectation than an agent would achieve if it acted alone. Our main contribution is a positive result: an asymptotically optimal, incentive compatible, and \emph{ex-ante} individually rational recommendation algorithm.</p> 
### 17.[Training Deep Energy-Based Models with f-Divergence Minimization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3257.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/130-Paper.pdf)
  Lantao Yu, Yang Song, Jiaming Song, Stefano Ermon [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/130-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/130-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Deep energy-based models (EBMs) are very flexible in distribution parametrization but computationally challenging because of the intractable partition function. They are typically trained via maximum likelihood, using contrastive divergence to approximate the gradient of the KL divergence between data and model distribution. While KL divergence has many desirable properties, other f-divergences have shown advantages in training implicit density generative models such as generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose a general variational framework termed f-EBM to train EBMs using any desired f-divergence. We introduce a corresponding optimization algorithm and prove its local convergence property with non-linear dynamical systems theory. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of f-EBM over contrastive divergence, as well as the benefits of training EBMs using f-divergences other than KL.</p> 
### 18.[Progressive Graph Learning for Open-Set Domain Adaptation](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3258.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/136-Paper.pdf)
  Yadan Luo, Zijian Wang, Zi Huang, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/136-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/136-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Domain shift is a fundamental problem in visual recognition which typically arises when the source and target data follow different distributions. The existing domain adaptation approaches which tackle this problem work in the "closed-set" setting with the assumption that the source and the target data share exactly the same classes of objects. In this paper, we tackle a more realistic problem of the "open-set" domain shift where the target data contains additional classes that were not present in the source data. More specifically, we introduce an end-to-end Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework where a graph neural network with episodic training is integrated to suppress underlying conditional shift and adversarial learning is adopted to close the gap between the source and target distributions. Compared to the existing open-set adaptation approaches, our approach guarantees to achieve a tighter upper bound of the target error. Extensive experiments on three standard open-set benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in open-set domain adaptation.</p> 
### 19.[Learning De-biased Representations with Biased Representations](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3259.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/138-Paper.pdf)
  Hyojin Bahng, SANGHYUK CHUN, Sangdoo Yun, Jaegul Choo, Seong Joon Oh [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/138-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/138-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on \textit{in-distribution} learning scenarios has led interesting advances, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles). Such biased models fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The \textit{cross-bias generalisation} problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be \textit{different} from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. Our experiments and analyses show that our method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved generalisation.</p> 
### 20.[Generalized Neural Policies for Relational MDPs](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3260.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/140-Paper.pdf)
  Sankalp Garg, Aniket Bajpai, Mausam  [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/140-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/140-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>A Relational Markov Decision Process (RMDP) is a first-order representation to express all instances of a single probabilistic planning domain with possibly unbounded number of objects.  Early work in RMDPs outputs generalized (instance-independent) first-order policies or value functions as a means to solve all instances of a domain at once. Unfortunately, this line of work met with limited success due to inherent limitations of the representation space used in such policies or value functions. Can neural models provide the missing link by easily representing more complex generalized policies, thus making them effective on all instances of a given domain?</p>  <p>We present the first neural approach for solving RMDPs, expressed in the probabilistic planning language of RDDL. Our solution first converts an RDDL instance into a ground DBN. We then extract a graph structure from the DBN. We train a relational neural model that computes an embedding for each node in the graph and also scores each ground action as a function over the first-order action variable and object embeddings on which the action is applied. In essence, this represents a neural generalized policy for the whole domain. Given a new test problem of the same domain, we can compute all node embeddings using trained parameters and score each ground action to choose the best action using a single forward pass without any retraining. Our experiments on nine RDDL domains from IPPC demonstrate that neural generalized policies are significantly better than random and sometimes even more effective than training a state-of-the-art deep reactive policy from scratch.</p> 
### 21.[Feature-map-level Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3261.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/143-Paper.pdf)
  Inseop Chung, SeongUk Park, Kim Jangho, NOJUN KWAK [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/143-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/143-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Feature maps contain rich information about image intensity and spatial correlation. However, previous online knowledge distillation methods only utilize the class probabilities. Thus in this paper, we propose an online knowledge distillation method that transfers not only the knowledge of the class probabilities but also that of the feature map using the adversarial training framework. We train multiple networks simultaneously by employing discriminators to distinguish the feature map distributions of different networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator which discriminates the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that of the other network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator, it can learn the other networkâs feature map distribution. We show that our method performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1 and is more suitable for online distillation. Also, we propose a novel cyclic learning scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied our method to various network architectures on the classification task and discovered a significant improvement of performance especially in the case of training a pair of a small network and a large one.</p>

  Zhizhong Han, Chao Chen, Yu-Shen Liu, Matthias Zwicker [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/145-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/145-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Differentiable renderers have been used successfully for unsupervised 3D structure learning from 2D images because they can bridge the gap between 3D and 2D. To optimize 3D shape parameters, current renderers rely on pixel-wise losses between rendered images of 3D reconstructions and ground truth images from corresponding viewpoints. Hence they require interpolation of the recovered 3D structure at each pixel, visibility handling, and optionally evaluating a shading model. In contrast, here we propose a Differentiable Renderer Without Rendering (DRWR) that omits these steps. DRWR only relies on a simple but effective loss that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object silhouette. Specifically, DRWR employs a smooth silhouette loss to pull the projection of each individual 3D point inside the object silhouette, and a structure-aware repulsion loss to push each pair of projections that fall inside the silhouette far away from each other. Although we omit surface interpolation, visibility handling, and shading, our results demonstrate that DRWR achieves state-of-the-art accuracies under widely used benchmarks, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, our training times are significantly lower due to the simplicity of DRWR.</p>

> <p>Network quantization is essential for deploying deep models to IoT devices due to the high efficiency, no matter on special hardware like TPU or general hardware like CPU and GPU. Most existing quantization approaches rely on retraining to retain accuracy, which is referred to as quantization-aware training. However, this quantization scheme assumes the access to the training data, which is not always the case. Moreover, retraining is a tedious and time-consuming procedure, which hinders the application of quantization to a wider range of tasks. Post-training quantization, on the other hand, does not have these problems. However, it has only been shown effective for 8-bit quantization due to the simple optimization strategy. In this paper, we propose a Bit-Split and Stitching framework for lower-bit post-training quantization with minimal accuracy degradation. The proposed framework are validated on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, with various network architectures.</p>

  Pan Zhou, Xiao-Tong Yuan [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/150-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/150-Supplemental.pdf)
> Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithms have been shown to work favorably in solving large-scale learning problems. Despite the remarkable success, the stochastic gradient complexity of SVRG-type algorithms usually scales linearly with data size and thus could still be expensive for huge data. To address this deficiency, we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic minibatch proximal gradient (HSDMPG) algorithm for strongly-convex problems that enjoys provably improved data-size-independent complexity guarantees. More precisely, for quadratic loss $F(\wm)$ of $n$ components, we prove that HSDMPG can attain an $\epsilon$-optimization-error  $E[F(\theta)-F(\theta^*)] \leq \epsilon$ within $\mathcal{O}\Big(\!\frac{\kappa^{1.5}}{\epsilon^{0.25}}\!  \log^{\!1.5}\!\!\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big) \wedge   \Big(\!\kappa \sqrt{n}  \log^2\!\!\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big) \!+\! \frac{\kappa^3}{n^{1.5}\epsilon} \!\Big)\!\Big)$ stochastic gradient evaluations, where $\kappa$ is condition number. For generic strongly convex loss functions, we prove a nearly identical complexity bound though at the cost of slightly increased logarithmic factors. For large-scale learning problems, our complexity bounds are superior to those of the prior state-of-the-art SVRG algorithms with or without dependence on data size. Particularly, in the case of $\epsilon\!=\!\mathcal{O}\big(1/\sqrt{n}\big)$ which is at the order of intrinsic excess error bound of a learning model and thus sufficient for generalization,  the stochastic gradient complexity bounds of HSDMPG~for quadratic and generic loss functions are respectively $\mathcal{O} (n^{0.875}\log^{1.5}(n))$ and $\mathcal{O} (n^{0.875}\log^{2.25}(n))$, which to our best knowledge, for the first time achieve optimal generalization in less than a single pass over data. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the computational advantages of our algorithm over the prior ones.

> We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for repeated second-price auctions with reserve where a seller interacts with multiple strategic bidders each of which holds a fixed private valuation for a good and seeks to maximize his expected future cumulative discounted surplus.	 We propose a novel algorithm that  has strategic regret upper bound of $O(\log\log T)$ for worst-case valuations. This pricing is based on our novel transformation that upgrades an algorithm designed for the setup with a single buyer to the multi-buyer case.  We provide theoretical guarantees on the ability of a transformed algorithm to  learn the valuation of a strategic buyer, which has uncertainty about  the future due to the presence of rivals.

  Tianyi Lin, Chi Jin, Michael Jordan [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/179-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/179-Supplemental.pdf)
> We consider nonconvex-concave minimax problems, $\min_{\mathbf{x}} \max_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$, where $f$ is nonconvex in $\mathbf{x}$ but concave in $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ is a convex and bounded set. One of the most popular algorithms for solving this problem is the celebrated gradient descent ascent (GDA) algorithm, which has been widely used in machine learning, control theory and economics. Despite the extensive convergence results for the convex-concave setting, GDA with equal stepsize can converge to limit cycles or even diverge in a general setting. In this paper, we present the complexity results on two-time-scale GDA for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems, showing that the algorithm can find a stationary point of the function $\Phi(\cdot) := \max_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\cdot, \mathbf{y})$ efficiently. To the best our knowledge, this is the first nonasymptotic analysis for two-time-scale GDA in this setting, shedding light on its superior practical performance in training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other real applications.

> <p>This paper formalizes the binarization operations over neural networks from a learning perspective. In contrast to classical hand crafted rules (\eg hard thresholding) to binarize full-precision neurons, we propose to learn a mapping from full-precision neurons to the target binary ones. Each individual weight entry will not be binarized independently. Instead, they are taken as a whole to accomplish the binarization, just as they work together in generating convolution features. To help the training of the binarization mapping, the full-precision neurons after taking sign operations is regarded as some auxiliary supervision signal, which is noisy but still has valuable guidance.  An unbiased estimator is therefore introduced to mitigate the influence of the supervision noise. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed binarization technique attains consistent improvements over baselines.</p>

> We propose a novel Stochastic Frank-Wolfe ($\equiv$ Conditional Gradient) algorithm with fixed batch size tailored to the constrained optimization of a finite sum of smooth objectives. We make use of a primal-dual interpretation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.   Recent work to design stochastic variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm fall into two categories: algorithms with increasing batch size, and algorithms with constant batch size. The former have faster convergence rates but are impractical; the latter are practical but slower. Our method combines the advantages of both: it converges for any constant batch size, and has faster theoretical worst case rates than previous fixed batch size algorithms. Our experiments also show faster empirical convergence than previous fixed batch methods for several tasks.   Finally, we construct a stochastic estimator of the Frank-Wolfe gap. It allows us to bound the true Frank-Wolfe gap, which is a primal-dual gap in the convex case and a measure of stationarity in general.  Our gap estimator can therefore be used as a practical stopping criterion in all cases.
### 29.Do We Really Need to Access the Source Data? Source Hypothesis Transfer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [:chains:](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3269.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/194-Paper.pdf)
  Jian Liang, Dapeng Hu, Jiashi Feng [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/194-Metadata.json)
> <p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned from a labeled source dataset to solve similar tasks in a new unlabeled domain. Prior UDA methods typically require to access the source data when learning to adapt the model, making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this work we tackle a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and investigate how we can effectively utilize such a model without source data to solve UDA problems. To this end, we propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework, named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). Specifically, SHOT freezes the classifier module (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis. In this way, the learned target model can directly predict the labels of target data. We further investigate several techniques to refine the network architecture to parameterize the source model for better transfer performance. To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks.</p>

> <p>We develop a framework for designing optimal optimization methods in terms of their average-case runtime. This yields a new class of methods that achieve acceleration through a model of the Hessian's expected spectral density. We develop explicit algorithms for the uniform, Marchenko-Pastur and exponential distribution. These methods are momentum-based gradient algorithms whose hyper-parameters can be estimated cheaply using only the norm and the trace of the Hessian, in stark contrast with classical accelerated methods like Nesterov acceleration and Polyak momentum that require knowledge of the Hessian's largest and smallest singular value. Empirical results on quadratic, logistic regression and neural network show the proposed methods always match and in many cases significantly improve upon classical accelerated methods.</p>

> <p>Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between the neurons. However, despite their wide use there is currently no understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of a neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate this relationship, via developing a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where computation is specified by rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using our novel framework we show that (1) there is a âsweet spotâ, where relational graphs within certain range of average path length and clustering coefficient lead to neural networks with significant improvements in predictive performance; (2) perhaps even more surprisingly, we find that these sweet spots tend to highly correlate across different architectures and datasets; and, (3) we show that discovering top-performing relational graphs only requires a few epochs of training. Overall, our results suggest promising avenues for designing and understanding neural networks with graph representations.</p>

> <p>Continual Learning (CL) algorithms incrementally learn a predictor or representation across multiple sequentially observed tasks. Designing CL algorithms that perform reliably and avoid so-called catastrophic forgetting has proven a persistent challenge. The current paper develops a theoretical approach that explains why. In particular, we derive the computational properties which CL algorithms would have to possess in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our main finding is that such optimal CL algorithms generally solve an NP-hard problem and will require perfect memory to do so. The findings are of theoretical interest, but also explain the excellent performance of CL algorithms using experience replay, episodic memory and core sets relative to regularization-based approaches.</p>

> <p>Standard reinforcement learning aims to find an optimal policy that identifies the best action for each state. However, in healthcare settings, many actions may be near-equivalent with respect to the reward (e.g., survival). We consider an alternative objective -- learning set-valued policies to capture near-equivalent actions that lead to similar cumulative rewards. We propose a model-free, off-policy algorithm based on temporal difference learning and a near-greedy action selection heuristic. We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm, providing optimality guarantees and demonstrate our approach on simulated environments and a real clinical task. Empirically, the proposed algorithm exhibits reasonably good convergence properties and discovers meaningful near-equivalent actions. Our work provides theoretical, as well as practical, foundations for clinician-in-the-loop decision making, in which clinicians/patients can incorporate additional knowledge (e.g., side effects and patient preference) to distinguish among near-equivalent actions. </p>

> <p>We study the computational and statistical tradeoffs in inferring combinatorial structures of high dimensional simple zero-field ferromagnetic Ising model. Under the framework of oracle computational model where an algorithm interacts with an oracle that discourses a randomized version of truth, we characterize the computational lower bounds of learning combinatorial structures in polynomial time, under which no algorithms within polynomial-time can distinguish between graphs with and without certain structures. This hardness of learning with limited computational budget is shown to be characterized by a novel quantity called vertex overlap ratio. Such quantity is universally valid for many specific graph structures including cliques and nearest neighbors. On the other side, we attain the optimal rates for testing these structures against empty graph by proposing the quadratic testing statistics to match the lower bounds. We also investigate the relationship between computational bounds and information-theoretic bounds for such problems, and found gaps between the two boundaries in inferring some particular structures, especially for those with dense edges.</p>

> <p>One fundamental problem in deep learning is understanding the outstanding performance of deep Neural Networks (NNs) in practice. One explanation for the superiority of NNs is that they can realize a large class of complicated functions, i.e., they have powerful expressivity. The expressivity of a ReLU NN can be quantified by the maximal number of linear regions it can separate its input space into. In this paper, we provide several mathematical results needed for studying the linear regions of CNNs, and use them to derive the maximal and average numbers of linear regions for one-layer ReLU CNNs. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of linear regions of multi-layer ReLU CNNs. Our results suggest that deeper CNNs have more powerful expressivity than their shallow counterparts, while CNNs have more expressivity than fully-connected NNs per parameter. </p>

> <p>In multi-label learning, each instance can be associated with multiple and non-exclusive labels. Previous studies assume that all the labels in the learning process are fixed and static; however, they ignore the fact that the labels will emerge continuously in changing environments. In order to fill in these research gaps, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based framework, Deep Streaming Label Learning (DSLL), to classify instances with newly emerged labels effectively. DSLL can explore and incorporate the knowledge from past labels and historical models to understand and develop emerging new labels. DSLL consists of three components: 1) a streaming label mapping to extract deep relationships between new labels and past labels with a novel label-correlation aware loss; 2) a streaming feature distillation propagating feature-level knowledge from the historical model to a new model; 3) a senior student network to model new labels with the help of knowledge learned from the past. Theoretically, we prove that DSLL admits tight generalization error bounds for new labels in the DNN framework. Experimentally, extensive empirical results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods to handle the continually emerging new labels.</p>

> <p>We show that on-policy policy gradient (PG) and its variance reduction variants can be derived by taking finite-difference of function evaluations supplied by estimators from the importance sampling (IS) family for off-policy evaluation (OPE). Starting from the doubly robust (DR) estimator (Jiang &amp; Li, 2016), we provide a simple derivation of a very general and flexible form of PG, which subsumes the state-of-the-art variance reduction technique (Cheng et al., 2019) as its special case and immediately hints at further variance reduction opportunities overlooked by existing literature. We analyze the variance of the new DR-PG estimator, compare it to existing methods as well as the Cramer-Rao lower bound of policy gradient, and empirically show its effectiveness.</p>

  Xiaobo Wang, Shuo Wang, Shifeng Zhang, Cheng Chi, Tao Mei [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/245-Metadata.json)
> <p>In face recognition, designing margin-based (\textit{e.g.}, angular, additive, additive angular margins) softmax loss functions plays an important role to learn discriminative features. However, these hand-crafted heuristic methods may be sub-optimal because they require much effort to explore the large design space. Recently, an AutoML for loss function search method AM-LFS has been derived, which leverages reinforcement learning to search loss functions during the training process. But its search space is complex and unstable that hindering its superiority. In this paper, we first analyze that the key to enhance the feature discrimination is actually \textbf{how to reduce the softmax probability}. We then design a unified formulation for the current margin-based softmax losses. Accordingly, we define a novel search space and develop a reward-guided search method to automatically obtain the best candidate. Experimental results on a variety of face recognition benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

> <p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has become an important approach to automatically find effective architectures. To cover all possible good architectures, we need to search in an extremely large search space with billions of candidate architectures. More critically, given a large search space, we may face a very challenging issue of space explosion. However, due to the limitation of computational resources, we can only sample a very small proportion of the architectures, which provides insufficient information for the training. As a result, existing methods may often produce suboptimal architectures. To alleviate this issue, we propose a curriculum search method that starts from a small search space and gradually incorporates the learned knowledge to guide the search in a large space. With the proposed search strategy, our Curriculum Neural Architecture Search (CNAS) method significantly improves the search efficiency and finds better architectures than existing NAS methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

> <p>Probabilistic programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in statistics, applied science, and machine learning: by decoupling modelling from inference, it promises to allow modellers to directly reason about the processes generating data. However, the performance of inference algorithms can be dramatically affected by the parameterisation used to express a model, requiring users to transform their programs in non-intuitive ways. We argue for automating these transformations, and demonstrate that mechanisms available in recent modelling frameworks can implement non-centring and related reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms, and we propose two: a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can yield more efficient samplers than the best fixed parameterisation.</p>

> <p>Cooperative multi-agent decision making involves a group of agents collectively solving individual learning problems, while communicating over a (sparse) network with delays. In this paper, we consider the kernelised contextual bandit problem, where the reward obtained by an agent is an arbitrary linear function of the contexts' images in the related reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a group of agents must cooperate to collectively solve their unique decision problems. We propose Coop-KernelUCB that provides near-optimal bounds on the per-agent regret in this setting, and is both computationally and communicatively efficient. For special cases of the cooperative problem, we also provide variants of Coop-KernelUCB that provides optimal per-agent regret. In addition, our algorithm generalizes several existing results in the multi-agent bandit setting. Finally, on a series of both synthetic and real-world multi-agent network benchmarks, our algorithm significantly outperforms existing clustering or consensus-based algorithms, even in the linear setting.</p>

> <p>We study the heavy-tailed stochastic bandit problem in the cooperative multiagent setting, where a group of agents interact with a common bandit problem, while communicating on a network with delays. Existing algorithms for the stochastic bandit in this setting utilize confidence intervals arising from an averaging-based communication protocol known as~\textit{running consensus}, that does not lend itself to robust estimation for heavy-tailed settings. We propose \textsc{MP-UCB}, a decentralized multi-agent algorithm for the cooperative stochastic bandit that incorporates robust estimation with a message-passing protocol. We prove optimal regret bounds for \textsc{MP-UCB} for several problem settings, and also demonstrate its superiority to existing methods. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for the cooperative bandit problem, in addition to providing efficient algorithms for robust bandit estimation of location.</p>

More specifically, we consider the case of a $k$-demand agent, whose valuation over the goods is additive when receiving up to $k$ goods, but who has no interest in receiving more than $k$ goods.  We settle the query complexity for the active-learning (preference elicitation) version, where the learner chooses the prices to post, by giving a {\em biased binary search} algorithm, generalizing the classical binary search procedure. We complement our query complexity upper bounds by lower bounds that match up to lower-order terms.  We also study the passive-learning version in which the learner does not control the prices, and instead they are sampled from some distribution.  We show that in the PAC model for passive learning, any {\em empirical risk minimizer} has a sample complexity that is optimal up to a factor of $\widetilde{O}(k)$.

> <p>Compared to dense networks, sparse neural networks are shown to be more parameter efficient, more compute efficient and have been used to decrease wall clock inference times.  There is a large body of work on training dense networks to yield sparse networks for inference, but this limits the size of the largest trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations.  We show that this approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally, we provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains static.</p>

> <p>Node classification in attributed graphs is an important task in multiple practical settings, but it can often be difficult or expensive to obtain labels. Active learning can improve the achieved classification performance for a given budget on the number of queried labels. The best existing methods are based on graph neural networks, but they often perform poorly unless a sizeable validation set of labelled nodes is available in order to choose good hyperparameters. We propose a novel graph-based active learning algorithm for the task of node classification in attributed graphs. Our algorithm uses graph cognizant logistic regression, equivalent to a linearized graph-convolutional neural network (GCNN), for the prediction phase and maximizes the expected error reduction in the query phase. To reduce the delayexperienced by a labeller interacting with the system, we derive a preemptive querying system that calculates a new query during the labelling process. To address the setting where learning starts with almost no labelled data, we also develop a hybrid algorithm that performs adaptive model averaging of label propagation and linearized GCNN inference. We conduct experiments on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. We illustrate the practical value of the method by applying it to a private commercial dataset that is used for the task of identifying faulty links in a microwave link network.</p>

> <p>When predictions support decisions they may influence the outcome they aim to predict. We call such predictions performative; the prediction influences the target. Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining.</p>  <p>We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal loss.</p>  <p>In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.</p>

> <p>The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.</p>

> <p>The Shapley value has become a popular method to attribute the prediction of a machine-learning model on an input to its base features. The use of the Shapley value is justified by citing ~\cite{Shapley53} showing that it is the \emph{unique} method that satisfies certain good properties (\emph{axioms}). </p>  <p>There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value is operationalized in the attribution problem. These differ in how they reference the model, the training data, and the explanation context. These give very different results, rendering the uniqueness result meaningless. Furthermore, we find that previously proposed approaches can produce counterintuitive attributions in theory and in practice---for instance, they can assign non-zero attributions to features that are not even referenced by the model. </p>  <p>In this paper, we use the axiomatic approach to study the differences between some of the many operationalizations of the Shapley value for attribution, and propose a technique called Baseline Shapley (BShap) that is backed by a proper uniqueness result. We also contrast BShap with Integrated Gradients, another extension of Shapley value to the continuous setting.</p>

> <p>Linear constrained convex programming (LCCP) has many practical applications, including support vector machine (SVM) and machine learning portfolio (MLP) problems. We propose the randomized primal-dual coordinate (RPDC) method, a randomized coordinate extension of the first-order primal-dual method by Cohen and Zhu, 1984 and Zhao and Zhu, 2019, to solve LCCP. We randomly choose a block of variables based on the uniform distribution and apply linearization and a Bregman-like function (core function) to the selected block to obtain simple parallel primal-dual decomposition for LCCP. We establish almost surely convergence and expected O(1/t) convergence rate. Under global strong metric subregularity, we establish the linear convergence of RPDC. Both SVM and MLP problems satisfy the global strong metric subregularity condition under some reasonable conditions. Finally, we discuss the implementation details of RPDC and present numerical experiments on SVM and MLP problems to verify the linear convergence.</p>

> We present three new algorithms for constructing differentially   private synthetic data---a sanitized version of a sensitive dataset   that approximately preserves the answers to a large collection of   statistical queries. All three algorithms are   \emph{oracle-efficient} in the sense that they are computationally   efficient when given access to an optimization oracle. Such an oracle can   be implemented using many existing (non-private)   optimization tools such as sophisticated integer program solvers. While the   accuracy of the synthetic data is contingent on the oracle&#x27;s   optimization performance, the algorithms satisfy differential   privacy even in the worst case. For all three algorithms, we provide   theoretical guarantees for both accuracy and privacy. Through   empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our methods scale well   with both the dimensionality of the data and the number of queries. In the high privacy   regime (corresponding to low privacy loss $\eps$), our algorithms achieve better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques, including the High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (McKenna et al.~VLDB 2018).

> <p>One of the most effective algorithms for differentially private learning and optimization is \emph{objective perturbation}. This technique augments a given optimization problem (e.g. deriving from an ERM problem) with a random linear term, and then exactly solves it. However, to date, analyses of this approach crucially rely on the convexity and smoothness of the objective function. We give two algorithms that extend this approach substantially. The first algorithm requires nothing except boundedness of the loss function, and operates over a discrete domain. Its privacy and accuracy guarantees hold even without assuming convexity. We are able to extend traditional analyses of objective perturbation by introducing a novel <code>normalization</code> step into the algorithm, which provides enough stability to be differentially private even without second-order conditions. The second algorithm operates over a continuous domain and requires only that the loss function be bounded and Lipschitz in its continuous parameter. Its privacy analysis does not even require convexity. Its accuracy analysis does require convexity, but does not require second order conditions like smoothness. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of the non-convex case, in which we use an integer program solver as our optimization oracle. We find that for the problem of learning linear classifiers, directly optimizing for 0/1 loss using our approach can out-perform the more standard approach of privately optimizing a convex-surrogate loss function on the Adult dataset.</p>

> <p>We consider the average-case runtime analysis of algorithms for minimizing quadratic objectives. In this setting, and contrary to the more classical worst-case analysis, non-asymptotic convergence rates and optimal algorithms depend on the full spectrum of the Hessian through its expected spectral distribution.  Under mild assumptions, we show that these optimal methods converge asymptotically towards Polyak momentum \emph{independently} of the expected spectral density. This makes Polyak momentum universally (i.e., independent of the spectral distribution) asymptotically average-case optimal.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This motivates robust learning techniques, such as the adversarial training, whose goal is to learn a network that is robust against adversarial attacks.  However, the sample complexity of robust learning can be significantly larger than that of âstandardâ learning. In this paper, we propose improving the adversarial robustness of a network by leveraging the potentially large test data seen at runtime. We devise a new defense method, called runtime masking and cleansing (RMC), that adapts the network at runtime before making a prediction to dynamically mask network gradients and cleanse the model of the non-robust features inevitably learned during the training process due to the size limit of the training set. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RMC empirically.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in various areas. However, recent works have found that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which leads to a hot topic nowadays. Although many approaches have been proposed to enhance the robustness of neural networks, few of them explored robust architectures for neural networks. On this account, we try to address such an issue from the perspective of dynamic system in this work. By viewing ResNet as an explicit Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), for the first time, we find that the adversarial robustness of ResNet is connected to the numerical stability of the corresponding dynamic system. Namely, more stable numerical schemes may correspond to more robust deep networks. Furthermore, inspired by the implicit Euler method for solving numerical ODE problems, we propose Implicit Euler skip connections (IE-Skips) by modifying the original skip connection in ResNet or its variants. Then we theoretically prove its advantages under the adversarial attack. Experimental results show that our ResNet with IE-Skips can largely improve the robustness and the generalization ability under adversarial attacks when compared with the vanilla ResNet of the same parameter size.</p>

> <p>We design and analyze CascadeBAI, an algorithm for finding the best set of K items, also called an arm, within the framework of cascading bandits. An upper bound on the time complexity of CascadeBAI is derived by overcoming a crucial analytical challenge, namely, that of probabilistically estimating the amount of available feedback at each step. To do so, we define a new class of random variables (r.v.'s) which we term as left-sided sub-Gaussian r.v.'s; these are r.v.'s whose cumulant generating functions (CGFs) can be bounded by a quadratic only for non-positive arguments of the CGFs. This enables the application of a sufficiently tight Bernstein-type concentration inequality. We show, through the derivation of a lower bound on the time complexity, that the performance of CascadeBAI is optimal in some practical regimes. Finally, extensive numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of CascadeBAI as well as the tightness of our upper bound on its time complexity.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks for natural language processing tasks are vulnerable to adversarial input perturbations. Existing works have proposed to improve the robustness against specific adversarial input perturbations (e.g., token substitutions), but do not consider general perturbations such as token insertions, token deletions, token swaps, etc. To fill this gap, we present a technique to train models that are robust to user-defined string transformations. Our technique combines data augmentation---to detect worst-case transformed inputs---and verifiable training using abstract interpretation---to further increase the robustness of the model on the worst-case transformed inputs. We use our technique to train models on the AG and SST2 datasets and show that the resulting models are robust to combinations of user-defined transformations mimicking spelling mistakes and other meaning-preserving transformations.</p>

> We study the iteration complexity of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for minimizing the gradient norm of smooth, possibly nonconvex functions. We provide several results, implying that the classical $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ upper bound (for making the average gradient norm less than $\epsilon$) cannot be improved upon, unless a combination of additional assumptions is made. Notably, this holds even if we limit ourselves to convex quadratic functions. We also show that for nonconvex functions, the feasibility of minimizing gradients with SGD is surprisingly sensitive to the choice of optimality criteria.

> The goal of standard 1-bit compressive sensing is to accurately recover an unknown sparse vector from binary-valued measurements, each indicating the sign of a linear function of the vector.  Motivated by recent advances in compressive sensing with generative models, where a generative modeling assumption replaces the usual sparsity assumption, we study the problem of 1-bit compressive sensing with generative models. We first consider noiseless 1-bit measurements, and provide sample complexity bounds for approximate recovery under i.i.d.~Gaussian measurements and a Lipschitz continuous generative prior, as well as a near-matching algorithm-independent lower bound. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Binary $\epsilon$-Stable Embedding property, which characterizes the robustness of the reconstruction to measurement errors and noise, also holds for 1-bit compressive sensing with Lipschitz continuous generative models with sufficiently many Gaussian measurements.  In addition, we apply our results to neural network generative models, and provide a proof-of-concept numerical experiment demonstrating significant improvements over sparsity-based approaches.

> <p>We consider imbalanced classification, the problem in which a label may have low marginal probability relative to other labels, by weighting losses according to the correct class.  First, we examine the convergence rates of the expected excess weighted risk of plug-in classifiers where the weighting for the plug-in classifier and the risk may be different. This leads to irreducible errors that do not converge to the weighted Bayes risk, which motivates our consideration of robust risks. We define a robust risk that minimizes risk over a set of weightings and show excess risk bounds for this problem.  Finally, we show that particular choices of the weighting set leads to a special instance of conditional value at risk (CVaR) from stochastic programming, which we call label conditional value at risk (LCVaR). Additionally, we generalize this weighting to derive a new robust risk problem that we call label heterogeneous conditional value at risk (LHCVaR). Finally, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of LCVaR and LHCVaR on improving class conditional risks.</p>

> <p>This paper searches for the optimal neural architecture  by minimizing a proxy of validation loss. Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods used to discover the optimal neural architecture that best fits the validation examples given the up-to-date network weights. However, back propagation with a number of validation examples could be time consuming, especially when it needs to be repeated many times in NAS. Though these  intermediate validation results are invaluable, they would be wasted if we cannot use them to predict the future from the past. In this paper, we propose to approximate the validation loss landscape by learning a mapping from neural architectures to their corresponding validate losses. The optimal neural architecture thus can be easily identified as the minimum of this proxy validation loss landscape. A novel sampling strategy is further developed for an efficient approximation of the loss landscape. Theoretical analysis indicates that our sampling strategy can reach a lower error rate and a lower label complexity compared with a uniform sampling. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that the architecture searched by the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory accuracy with less time cost.</p>

> <p>The variance reduction class of algorithms including the representative ones, SVRG and SARAH, have well documented merits for empirical risk minimization problems. However, they require grid search to tune parameters (step size and the number of iterations per inner loop) for optimal performance. This work introduces <code>almost tune-free' SVRG and SARAH schemes equipped with i) Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step sizes; ii) averaging; and, iii) the inner loop length adjusted to the BB step sizes. In particular, SVRG, SARAH, and their BB variants are first reexamined through an</code>estimate sequence' lens to enable new averaging methods that tighten their convergence rates theoretically, and improve their performance empirically when the step size or the inner loop length is chosen large. Then a simple yet effective means to adjust the number of iterations per inner loop is developed to enhance the merits of the proposed averaging schemes and BB step sizes. Numerical tests corroborate the proposed methods.</p>

> <p>The decision-theoretic foundations of classical machine learning models have largely focused on estimating model parameters that minimize the expectation of a given loss function. However, as machine learning models are deployed in varied contexts, such as in high-stakes decision-making and societal settings, it is clear that these models are not just evaluated by their average performances. In this work, we study a novel notion of L-Risk based on the classical idea of rank-weighted learning. These L-Risks, induced by rank-dependent weighting functions with bounded variation, is a unification of popular risk measures such as conditional value-at-risk and those defined by cumulative prospect theory. We give uniform convergence bounds of this broad class of risk measures and study their consequences on a logistic regression example.</p>

> <p>State-of-the-art neural machine translation models generate a translation from left to right and every step is conditioned on the previously generated tokens. The sequential nature of this generation process causes fundamental latency in inference since we cannot generate multiple tokens in each sentence in parallel. We propose an attention-masking based model, called Disentangled Context (DisCo) transformer, that simultaneously generates all tokens given different contexts. The DisCo transformer is trained to predict every output token given an arbitrary subset of the other reference tokens. We also develop the parallel easy-first inference algorithm, which iteratively refines every token in parallel and reduces the number of required iterations. Our extensive experiments on 7 translation directions with varying data sizes demonstrate that our model achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state of the art in non-autoregressive machine translation while significantly reducing decoding time on average. </p>

> <p>Researches using margin based comparison loss demonstrate the effectiveness of penalizing the distance between face feature and their corresponding class centers. Despite their popularity and excellent performance, they do not explicitly encourage the generic embedding learning for an open set recognition problem. In this paper, we analyse margin based softmax loss in probability view. With this perspective, we propose two general principles: 1) monotonically decreasing and 2) margin probability penalty, for designing new margin loss functions. Unlike methods optimized with single comparison metric, we provide a new perspective to treat open set face recognition as a problem of information transmission.  And the generalization capability for face embedding is gained with more clean information. An auto-encoder architecture called Linear-Auto-TS-Encoder(LATSE) is proposed to corroborate this finding. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that LATSE help face embedding to gain more generalization capability and it boost the single model performance with open training dataset to more than 99% on MegaFace test.</p>

  Wang Chi Cheung, David Simchi-Levi, Ruihao Zhu [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/488-Metadata.json)
> <p>We consider un-discounted reinforcement learning (RL) in  Markov decision processes (MDPs) under drifting non-stationarity, \ie, both the reward and state transition distributions are allowed to evolve over time, as long as their respective total variations, quantified by suitable metrics, do not exceed certain \emph{variation budgets}. We first develop the Sliding Window Upper-Confidence bound for Reinforcement Learning with Confidence Widening (\texttt{SWUCRL2-CW}) algorithm, and establish its dynamic regret bound when the variation budgets are known. In addition, we propose the Bandit-over-Reinforcement Learning (\texttt{BORL}) algorithm to adaptively tune the \sw~to achieve the same dynamic regret bound, but  in a \emph{parameter-free} manner, \ie, without knowing the variation budgets. Notably, learning drifting MDPs via conventional optimistic exploration presents a unique challenge absent in existing (non-stationary) bandit learning settings. We overcome the challenge by a novel confidence widening technique that incorporates additional optimism.</p>

> In this paper, we consider the problem of sleeping bandits with stochastic action sets and adversarial rewards. In this setting, in contrast to most work in bandits, the actions may not be available at all times. For instance, some products might be out of stock in item recommendation. The best existing efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms for this problem only guarantee a $O(T^{2/3})$ upper-bound on the regret. Yet, inefficient algorithms based on EXP4 can achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$.  In this paper, we provide a new computationally efficient algorithm inspired by EXP3 satisfying a regret of order  $O(\sqrt{T})$ when the availabilities of each action $i \in \cA$ are independent. We then study the most general version of the problem where at each round available sets are generated from some unknown arbitrary distribution (i.e., without the independence assumption) and propose an efficient algorithm with $O(\sqrt {2^K T})$ regret guarantee. Our theoretical results are corroborated with experimental evaluations.

> We consider PAC learning a good item from $k$-subsetwise feedback sampled from a Plackett-Luce probability model, with instance-dependent sample complexity performance. In the setting where subsets of a fixed size can be tested and top-ranked feedback is made available to the learner, we give an optimal instance-dependent algorithm with a  sample complexity bound for PAC best arm identification algorithm of  $O\bigg(\frac{\Theta_{[k]}}{k}\sum_{i = 2}^n\max\Big(1,\frac{1}{\Delta_i^2}\Big) \ln\frac{k}{\delta}\Big(\ln \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\Big)\bigg)$, $\Delta_i$ being the Plackett-Luce parameter gap between the best and the $i^{th}$ best item, and $\Theta_{[k]}$ is the sum of the Plackett-Luce parameters for top-$k$ items. The algorithm is based on a wrapper around a PAC winner-finding algorithm with weaker performance guarantees to adapt to the hardness of the input instance. The sample complexity is also shown to be multiplicatively better depending on the length of rank-ordered feedback available in each subset-wise play. We show optimality of our algorithms with matching sample complexity lower bounds. We next address the winner-finding problem in Plackett-Luce models in the fixed-budget setting with instance dependent upper and lower bounds on the misidentification probability, of $\Omega\left(\exp(-2 \tilde \Delta Q) \right)$ for a given budget $Q$, where $\tilde \Delta$ is an explicit instance-dependent problem complexity parameter. Numerical performance results are also reported for the algorithms.

> <p>Devising indicative evaluation metrics for the image generation task remains an open problem. The most widely used metric for measuring the similarity between real and generated images has been the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Since it does not differentiate the fidelity and diversity aspects of the generated images, recent papers have introduced variants of precision and recall metrics to diagnose those properties separately. In this paper, we show that even the latest version of the precision and recall metrics are not reliable yet. For example, they fail to detect the match between two identical distributions, they are not robust against outliers, and the evaluation hyperparameters are selected arbitrarily. We propose density and coverage metrics that solve the above issues. We analytically and experimentally show that density and coverage provide more interpretable and reliable signals for practitioners than the existing metrics.</p> 
### 69.Learning Factorized Weight Matrix for Joint Image Filtering [:chains:](https://proceedings.icml.cc/book/3309.pdf)[ :link: ](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/506-Paper.pdf)
  Xiangyu Xu, Yongrui Ma, Wenxiu Sun [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/506-Metadata.json)
> <p>Joint image filtering is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in many different areas. Most existing algorithms solve this problem with a weighted averaging process to aggregate input pixels. However, the weight matrix of this process is often empirically designed and not robust to complex input. In this work, we propose to learn the weight matrix for joint image filtering. This is a challenging problem, as directly learning a large weight matrix is computationally intractable. To address this issue, we introduce the correlation of deep features to approximate the aggregation weights. However, this strategy only uses inner product for the weight matrix estimation, which limits the performance of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, we further propose to learn a nonlinear function to predict sparse residuals of the feature correlation matrix. Note that the proposed method essentially factorizes the weight matrix into a low-rank and a sparse matrix and then learn both of them simultaneously with deep neural networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide variety of joint image filtering tasks.</p>

> <p>Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations. Typically, these forward models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners to rely on approximations. This work introduces a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model. We achieve this by learning a flexible amortized estimator which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. We demonstrate that the learned ratio estimator can be embedded in \textsc{mcmc} samplers to approximate likelihood-ratios between consecutive states in the Markov chain, allowing us to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are presented to improve the numerical stability and to measure the quality of an approximation. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated on a variety of benchmarks against well-established techniques. Scientific applications in physics show its applicability.</p>

> <p>Adversarial training based on the minimax formulation is necessary for obtaining adversarial robustness of trained models. However, it is conservative or even pessimistic so that it sometimes hurts the natural generalization. In this paper, we raise a fundamental question---do we have to trade off natural generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least adversarial (i.e., friendly adversarial) data minimizing the loss, among the adversarial data that are confidently misclassified. Our novel formulation is easy to implement by just stopping the most-adversarial data searching algorithms such as PGD (projected gradient descent) early, which we call early-stopped PGD. Theoretically, FAT is justified by an upper bound of the adversarial risk. Empirically, early-stopped PGD allows us to answer the earlier question negatively---adversarial robustness can indeed be achieved without compromising the natural generalization.</p>

> <p>We present GradientDICE for estimating the density ratio between the state distribution of the target policy and the sampling distribution in off-policy reinforcement learning. GradientDICE fixes several problems of GenDICE (Zhang et al., 2020), the current state-of-the-art for estimating such density ratios.  Namely, the optimization problem in GenDICE is not a convex-concave saddle-point problem once nonlinearity in optimization variable parameterization is introduced to ensure positivity,  so primal-dual algorithms are not guaranteed to find the desired solution.  However, such nonlinearity is essential to ensure the consistency of GenDICE even with a tabular representation. This is a fundamental contradiction, resulting from GenDICE's original formulation of the optimization problem. In GradientDICE, we optimize a different objective from GenDICE by using the Perron-Frobenius theorem and eliminating GenDICE's use of divergence, such that nonlinearity in parameterization is not necessary for GradientDICE,  which is provably convergent under linear function approximation.</p>

> <p>We present the first provably convergent two-timescale off-policy actor-critic algorithm (COF-PAC) with function approximation. Key to COF-PAC is the introduction of a new critic, the emphasis critic,  which is trained via Gradient Emphasis Learning (GEM),  a novel combination of the key ideas of Gradient Temporal Difference Learning and Emphatic Temporal Difference Learning. With the help of the emphasis critic and the canonical value function critic,  we show convergence for COF-PAC, where the critics are linear and the actor can be nonlinear. </p>

> <p>We develop an effective generation of adversarial attacks on neural models that output a sequence of probability distributions rather than a sequence of single values. This setting includes the recently proposed deep probabilistic autoregressive forecasting models that estimate the probability distribution of a time series given its past and achieve state-of-the-art results in a diverse set of application domains. The key technical challenge we address is how to effectively differentiate through the Monte-Carlo estimation of statistics of the output sequence joint distribution. Additionally, we extend prior work on probabilistic forecasting to the Bayesian setting which allows conditioning on future observations, instead of only on past observations. We demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate attacks with small input perturbations in two challenging tasks where robust decision making is crucial -- stock market trading and prediction of electricity consumption.</p>

> <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to rely more on local texture rather than global shape when making decisions. Recent work also indicates a close relationship between CNN's texture-bias and its robustness against distribution shift, adversarial perturbation, random corruption, etc. In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's texture bias. Specifically, with inspiration from human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness in various tasks (domain generalization, few-shot classification, robustness against random corruptions and adversarial robustness). Moreover, we show that as a local algorithm, InfoDrop can further improve performance when incorporated with other algorithms for global structure modeling (e.g. Non-Local blocks). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to improve different kinds of robustness in a unified model, shedding new light on relationship between shape-bias and robustness, also on new approaches to trustworthy machine learning algorithms.</p>

> <p>Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is widely used in graph data learning tasks such as recommendation. When facing to a large graph, the graph convolution is very computational expensive thus is simplified in all existing GCNs, while is seriously impaired due to the oversimplification. To address this gap, we leverage the original graph convolution in GCN and propose a Low-pass Collaborative Filter (LCF) to make it applicable to the large graph. LCF is designed to remove the noise in observed data, and it also reduces the complexity of graph convolution without hurting its ability. Experiments show that LCF improves the effectiveness and efficiency of graph convolution and our GCN outperforms existing GCNs significantly.</p>

> <p>Sorting is an important procedure in computer science. However, the argsort operator - which takes as input a vector and returns its sorting per-mutation - has a discrete image and thus zero gradients almost everywhere. This prohibits end-to-end, gradient-based learning of models that rely on the argsort operator. A natural way to overcome this problem is to replace the argsort operator with a continuous relaxation. Recent work has shown a number of ways to do this. However, the relaxations proposed so far are computationally complex. In this work we propose a simple continuous relaxation for the argsort operator. Unlike previous works, our relaxation is straight-forward: it can be implemented in three lines of code, achieves state-of-the-art performance, is easy to reason about mathematically - substantially simplifying proofs - and is up to six times faster than competing approaches. We open-source the code to reproduce all of the experiments</p>

> <p>We address the problem of classification under fairness constraints. Given a notion of fairness, the goal is to learn a classifier that is not discriminatory against a group of individuals. In the literature, this problem is often formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved using relaxations of the fairness constraints. We show that many existing relaxations are unsatisfactory: even if a model satisfies the relaxed constraint, it can be surprisingly unfair. We propose a principled framework to solve this problem. This new approach uses a strongly convex formulation and comes with theoretical guarantees on the fairness of its solution. In practice, we show that this method gives promising results on real data.</p>

> <p>We present a neural network architecture that is fully equivariant with respect to transformations under the Lorentz group, a fundamental symmetry of space and time in physics. The architecture is based on the theory of the finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group and the equivariant nonlinearity involves the tensor product. For classification tasks in particle physics, we show that such an equivariant architecture leads to drastically simpler models that have relatively few learnable parameters and are much more physically interpretable than leading approaches that use CNNs and point cloud approaches. The performance of the network is tested on a public classification dataset [https://zenodo.org/record/2603256] for tagging top quark decays given energy-momenta of jet constituents produced in proton-proton collisions.</p>

> <p>To scale up data analysis, distributed and parallel computing approaches are increasingly needed. Here we study a fundamental problem in this area: How to do ridge regression in a distributed computing environment? We study one-shot methods constructing weighted combinations of ridge regression estimators computed on each machine. By analyzing the mean squared error in a high dimensional model where each predictor has a small effect, we discover several new phenomena including that the efficiency depends strongly on the signal strength, but does not degrade with many workers, the risk decouples over machines, and the unexpected consequence that the optimal weights do not sum to unity. We also propose a new optimally weighted one-shot ridge regression algorithm. Our results are supported by simulations and real data analysis.</p>

> <p>Maximizing on k-submodular functions subject to size constraint has received extensive attention recently. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic scenario of this problem that (1) obtaining exact evaluation of an objective function is impractical, instead, its noisy version is acquired; and (2) algorithms are required to take only one single pass over dataset, producing solutions in a timely manner. We propose two novel streaming algorithms, namely DStream and RStream, with their theoretical performance guarantees. We further demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in two application, showing that our algorithms can return comparative results to state-of-the-art non-streaming methods while using a much fewer number of queries.</p>

> <p>Learning from demonstrations can be challenging when the quality of demonstrations is diverse, and even more so when the quality is unknown and there is no additional information to estimate the quality. We propose a new method for imitation learning in such scenarios. We show that simple quality-estimation approaches might fail due to compounding error, and fix this issue by jointly estimating both the quality and reward using a variational approach. Our method is easy to implement within reinforcement-learning frameworks and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on continuous-control benchmarks.Our work enables scalable and data-efficient imitation learning under more realistic settings than before.</p>

> <p>Beyond machine learning's success in the specific tasks, research for learning multiple tasks simultaneously is referred to as multi-task learning. However, existing multi-task learning needs manual definition of tasks and manual task annotation. A crucial problem for advanced intelligence is how to understand the human task concept using basic input-output pairs. Without task definition, samples from multiple tasks are mixed together and result in a confusing mapping challenge. We propose Confusing Supervised Learning (CSL) that takes these confusing samples and extracts task concepts by differentiating between these samples. We theoretically proved the feasibility of the CSL framework and designed an iterative algorithm to distinguish between tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our CSL methods could achieve a human-like task understanding without task labeling in multi-function regression problems and multi-task recognition problems.</p>

> <p>We propose a novel interactive learning framework which we refer to as Interactive Attention Learning (IAL), in which the human supervisors interactively manipulate the allocated attentions, to correct the model's behavior by updating the attention-generating network. However, such a model is prone to overfitting due to scarcity of human annotations, and requires costly retraining. Moreover, it is almost infeasible for the human annotators to examine attentions on tons of instances and features. We tackle these challenges by proposing a sample-efficient attention mechanism and a cost-effective reranking algorithm for instances and features. First, we propose Neural Attention Process (NAP), which is an attention generator that can update its behavior by incorporating new attention-level supervisions without any retraining. Secondly, we propose an algorithm which prioritizes the instances and the features by their negative impacts, such that the model can yield large improvements with minimal human feedback. We validate IAL on various time-series datasets from multiple domains (healthcare, real-estate, and computer vision) on which it significantly outperforms baselines with conventional attention mechanisms, or without cost-effective reranking, with substantially less retraining and human-model interaction cost.</p>

> <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically constructed by stacking multiple building blocks, each of which contains a normalization layer such as batch normalization (BN) and a rectified linear function such as ReLU.  However, this work shows that the combination of normalization and rectified linear function leads to inhibited channels, which have small magnitude and contribute little to the learned feature representation, impeding the generalization ability of CNNs. Unlike prior arts that simply removed the inhibited channels, we propose to ``wake them up'' during training by designing a novel neural building block, termed Channel Equilibrium (CE) block, which enables channels at the same layer to contribute equally to the learned representation. We show that CE is able to prevent inhibited channels both empirically and theoretically. CE has several appealing benefits. (1) It can be integrated into many advanced CNN architectures such as ResNet and MobileNet, outperforming their original networks. (2) CE has an interesting connection with the Nash Equilibrium, a well-known solution of a non-cooperative game. (3) Extensive experiments show that CE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks such as ImageNet and COCO. </p>

> We study learning algorithms that optimize revenue in repeated contextual posted-price auctions where a seller interacts with a single strategic buyer that seeks to maximize his cumulative discounted surplus. The buyer&#x27;s valuation of a good is a fixed private function of a $d$-dimensional context (feature) vector that describes the good being sold. In contrast to existing studies on repeated contextual auctions with strategic buyer, in our work, the seller is not assumed to know the parametric model that underlies this valuation function. We introduce a novel non-parametric learning algorithm that is horizon-independent and has tight strategic regret upper bound of $\Theta(T^{d/(d+1)})$. We also non-trivially generalize several value-localization techniques of non-contextual repeated auctions  to make them effective in  the considered contextual non-parametric learning of the buyer valuation function.

> <p>We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the input space in latent representations of autoencoders. Using persistent homology, a technique from topological data analysis, we calculate topological signatures of both the input and latent space to derive a topological loss term.  Under weak theoretical assumptions, we construct this loss in a differentiable manner, such that the encoding learns to retain multi-scale connectivity information.  We show that our approach is theoretically well-founded and that it exhibits favourable latent representations on a synthetic manifold as well as on real-world image data sets, while preserving low reconstruction errors.</p>

> <p>Derivative-free optimization (DFO) has recently gained a lot of momentum in machine learning, spawning interest in the community to design faster methods for problems where gradients are not accessible. While some attention has been given to the concept of acceleration in the DFO literature, there exists no algorithm with a provably accelerated rate of convergence for objective functions with a finite-sum structure. Stochastic algorithms that use acceleration in such a setting are prone to instabilities, making it difficult to reach convergence. In this work, we exploit the finite-sum structure of the objective to design a variance-reduced DFO algorithm that probably yields an accelerated rate of convergence. We prove rates of convergence for both smooth convex and strongly-convex finite-sum objective functions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on several datasets.</p>

> The attribution problem, that is the problem of attributing a model&#x27;s prediction to its base features, is well-studied. We extend the notion of attribution to also apply to feature interactions.  The Shapley value is a commonly used method to attribute a model&#x27;s prediction to its base features. We propose a generalization of the Shapley value called Shapley-Taylor index that attributes the model&#x27;s prediction to interactions of subsets of features up to some size $k$. The method is analogous to how the truncated Taylor Series decomposes the function value at a certain point using its  derivatives at a different point. In fact, we show that the Shapley Taylor index is equal to the Taylor Series of the multilinear extension of the set-theoretic behavior of the model.     We axiomatize this method using the standard Shapley axioms---linearity, dummy, symmetry and efficiency---and an additional axiom that we call the interaction distribution axiom. This new axiom explicitly characterizes how interactions are distributed for a class of functions that model pure interaction.   We contrast the Shapley-Taylor index against the previously proposed Shapley Interaction index from the cooperative game theory literature. We also apply the Shapley Taylor index to three models and identify interesting qualitative insights.

> <p>The change-point detection problem seeks to identify distributional changes in streams of data. Increasingly, tools for change-point detection are applied in settings where data may be highly sensitive and formal privacy guarantees are required, such as identifying disease outbreaks based on hospital records, or IoT devices detecting activity within a home. Differential privacy has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling data analysis while preventing information leakage about individuals. Much of the prior work on change-point detection---including the only private algorithms for this problem---requires complete knowledge of the pre-change and post-change distributions. However, this assumption is not realistic for many practical applications of interest. This work develops differentially private algorithms for solving the change-point problem when the data distributions are unknown. Additionally, the data may be sampled from distributions that change smoothly over time, rather than fixed pre-change and post-change distributions.  We apply our algorithms to detect changes in the linear trends of such data streams. We also provide experimental results to empirically validate the performance of our algorithms.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of learning Granger causality between event types from asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. Existing work suffers from either limited model flexibility or poor model explainability and thus fails to uncover Granger causality across a wide variety of event sequences with diverse event interdependency. To address these weaknesses, we propose CAUSE (Causality from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework for the studied task. The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the underlying event interdependency by fitting a neural point process, and then extract from the process a Granger causality statistic using an axiomatic attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled with diverse event interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior performance on correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range of state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> <p>Tasks in multi-task learning often correlate, conflict, or even compete with each other. As a result, a single solution that is optimal for all tasks rarely exists. Recent papers introduced the concept of Pareto optimality to this field and directly cast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization problems, but solutions returned by existing methods are typically finite, sparse, and discrete. We present a novel, efficient method that generates locally continuous Pareto sets and Pareto fronts, which opens up the possibility of continuous analysis of Pareto optimal solutions in machine learning problems. We scale up a recent theoretical result in multi-objective optimization to modern machine learning problems by proposing a sample-based sparse linear system, for which standard Hessian-free solvers in machine learning can be applied. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate its usage of analyzing local Pareto sets on various multi-task classification problems. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm reveals the primary directions in local Pareto sets for trade-off balancing, finds more solutions with different trade-offs efficiently, and scales well to tasks with millions of parameters.</p>

  Wei Ping, Kainan Peng, Kexin Zhao, Zhao Song [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/647-Metadata.json)
> <p>In this work, we propose WaveFlow, a small-footprint generative flow for raw audio, which is directly trained with maximum likelihood. It handles the long-range structure of 1-D waveform with a dilated 2-D convolutional architecture, while modeling the local variations using expressive autoregressive functions. WaveFlow provides a unified view of likelihood-based models for 1-D data, including WaveNet and WaveGlow as special cases. It generates high-fidelity speech as WaveNet, while synthesizing several orders of magnitude faster as it only requires a few sequential steps to generate very long waveforms with hundreds of thousands of time-steps. Furthermore, it can significantly reduce the likelihood gap that has existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models for efficient synthesis. Finally, our small-footprint WaveFlow has only 5.91M parameters, which is 15Ã smaller than WaveGlow. It can generate 22.05 kHz high-fidelity audio 42.6Ã faster than real-time (at a rate of 939.3 kHz) on a V100 GPU without engineered inference kernels.</p>

> <p>Centralized training with decentralized execution has become an important paradigm in multi-agent learning. Though practical, current methods rely on restrictive assumptions to decompose the centralized  value function across agents for execution. In this paper, we eliminate this restriction by proposing multi-agent determinantal Q-learning. Our method is established on Q-DPP, a novel extension of determinantal point process (DPP) to multi-agent setting. Q-DPP promotes agents to acquire diverse behavioral models; this allows  a natural factorization of the joint Q-functions with no need for \emph{a priori} structural constraints on the value function or special network architectures. We demonstrate that Q-DPP generalizes major solutions including VDN, QMIX, and QTRAN on decentralizable cooperative tasks. To efficiently draw samples  from Q-DPP, we develop a linear-time sampler with theoretical approximation guarantee. Our sampler also benefits exploration by  coordinating agents to cover orthogonal directions in the state space during training. We evaluate our algorithm on multiple cooperative benchmarks; its effectiveness has been demonstrated when compared with the state-of-the-art. </p>

> <p>Convolutional neural networks are among the most successful architectures in deep learning. This success is at least partially attributable to the efficacy of spatial invariance as an inductive bias. Locally connected layers, which differ from convolutional layers only in their lack of spatial invariance, usually perform poorly in practice. However, these observations still leave open the possibility that some degree of relaxation of spatial invariance may yield a better inductive bias than either convolution or local connectivity. To test this hypothesis, we design a method to relax the spatial invariance of a network layer in a controlled manner. In particular, we create a \textit{low-rank} locally connected layer, where the kernel applied at each position is constructed as a linear combination of basis kernels with spatially varying combining weights. By varying the number of basis kernels, we can control the degree of relaxation of spatial invariance. In our experiments, we find that relaxing spatial invariance improves classification accuracy over both convolution and locally connected layers across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. These results suggest that spatial invariance may be an overly restrictive prior.</p>

> <p>We provide theoretical investigations into off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning using function approximators for (marginalized) importance weights and value functions. Our contributions include: (1) A new estimator, MWL, that directly estimates importance ratios over the state-action distributions, removing the reliance on knowledge of the behavior policy as in prior work  (Liu et.al, 2018), (2) Another new estimator, MQL, obtained by swapping the roles of importance weights and value-functions in MWL. MQL has an intuitive interpretation of minimizing average Bellman errors and can be combined with MWL in a doubly robust manner, (3) Several additional results that offer further insights, including the sample complexities of MWL and MQL, their asymptotic optimality in the tabular setting, how the learned importance weights depend the choice of the discriminator class, and how our methods provide a unified view of some old and new algorithms in RL.</p>

> <p>Higher-order tensors arise frequently in applications such as neuroimaging, recommendation system, and social network analysis. We consider the problem of low-rank tensor estimation from possibly incomplete, ordinal-valued observations. Two related problems are studied, one on tensor denoising and another on tensor completion. We propose a multi-linear cumulative link model, develop a rank-constrained M-estimator, and obtain theoretical accuracy guarantees. Our mean squared error bound enjoys a faster convergence rate than previous results, and we show that the proposed estimator is minimax optimal under the class of low-rank models. Furthermore, the procedure developed serves as an efficient completion method which guarantees consistent recovery of an order-K (d,...,d)-dimensional low-rank tensor using only O(Kd) noisy, quantized observations. We demonstrate the outperformance of our approach over previous methods on the tasks of clustering and collaborative filtering. </p>

> <p>We seek to align agent behavior with a user's objectives in a reinforcement learning setting with unknown dynamics, an unknown reward function, and unknown unsafe states. The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user is expensive. We propose an algorithm that safely and efficiently learns a model of the user's reward function by posing 'what if?' questions about hypothetical agent behavior. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different initial state distributions. Moreover, ReQueST safely trains the reward model to detect unsafe states, and corrects reward hacking before deploying the agent.</p>

> <p>We study the model selection problem in \textit{conditional average treatment effect} (CATE) prediction. Unlike previous works on this topic, we focus on preserving the rank order of the performance of candidate CATE predictors to enable accurate and stable model selection. To this end, we analyze the model performance ranking problem and formulate guidelines to obtain a better evaluation metric. We then propose a novel metric that can identify the ranking of the performance of CATE predictors with high confidence. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our metric outperforms existing metrics in both model selection and hyperparameter tuning tasks.</p>

> <p>We consider the problem of the limited-bandwidth communication for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents cooperate with the assistance of a communication protocol and a scheduler. The protocol and scheduler jointly determine which agent is communicating what message and to whom. Under the limited bandwidth constraint, a communication protocol is required to generate informative messages. Meanwhile, an unnecessary communication connection should not be established because it occupies limited resources in vain. In this paper, we develop an Informative Multi-Agent Communication (IMAC) method to learn efficient communication protocols as well as scheduling. First, from the perspective of communication theory, we prove that the limited bandwidth constraint requires low-entropy messages throughout the transmission. Then inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we learn a valuable and compact communication protocol and a weight-based scheduler. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method, we conduct extensive experiments in various cooperative and competitive multi-agent tasks with different numbers of agents and different bandwidths. We show that IMAC converges faster and leads to efficient communication among agents under the limited bandwidth as compared to many baseline methods.</p>

> <p>Monocular multi-object detection and localization in 3D space has been proven to be a challenging task. The MoNet3D algorithm is a novel and effective framework that can predict the 3D position of each object in a monocular image, and draw a 3D bounding box on each object. The MoNet3D method incorporates the prior knowledge of spatial geometric correlation of neighboring objects into the deep neural network training process, in order to improve the accuracy of 3D object localization. Experiments over the KITTI data set show that the accuracy of predicting the depth and horizontal coordinate of the object in 3D space can reach 96.25% and 94.74%,  respectively. Meanwhile, the method can realize the real-time image processing capability of 27.85 FPS. Our demo and code will be published on GitHub when the paper is accepted.</p>

> <p>Given data with noisy labels, over-parameterized deep networks can gradually memorize the data, and fit everything in the end. Although equipped with corrections for noisy labels, many learning methods in this area still suffer overfitting due to undesired memorization. In this paper, to relieve this issue, we propose stochastic integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA): in a mini-batch, we adopt gradient descent on good data as usual, and learning-rate-reduced gradient ascent} on bad data; the proposal is a versatile approach where data goodness or badness is w.r.t. desired or undesired memorization given a base learning method. Technically, SIGUA pulls optimization back for generalization when their goals conflict with each other; philosophically, SIGUA shows forgetting undesired memorization can reinforce desired memorization. Experiments demonstrate that SIGUA successfully robustifies two typical base learning methods, so that their performance is often significantly improved.</p>

> We study multinomial logit bandit with limited adaptivity, where the algorithms change their exploration actions as infrequently as possible when achieving almost optimal minimax regret. We propose two measures of adaptivity: the assortment switching cost and the more fine-grained item switching cost. We present an anytime algorithm (AT-DUCB) with $O(N \log T)$ assortment switches, almost matching the lower bound $\Omega(\frac{N \log T}{ \log \log T})$. In the fixed-horizon setting, our algorithm FH-DUCB incurs $O(N \log \log T)$ assortment switches, matching the asymptotic lower bound. We also present the ESUCB algorithm with item switching cost $O(N \log^2 T)$.

> <p>We introduce Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework that combines deep learning with constraint reasoning for solving pattern de-mixing problems, typically in an unsupervised or very-weakly-supervised setting. DRNets exploit problem structure and prior knowledge by tightly combining constraint reasoning with stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization. Our motivating task is from materials discovery and concerns inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). Given the complexity of its underlying scientific domain, we start by introducing DRNets on an analogous but much simpler task: de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku). On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets almost perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus' digits, with 100\% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models. On Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, DRNets significantly outperform the state of the art and experts' capabilities, recovering more precise and physically meaningful crystal structures.</p>

> <p>On a periodic basis, publicly traded companies are required to report fundamentals: financial data such as revenue, earnings, debt, etc., providing insight into the companyâs financial health. Quantitative finance research has identified several factorsâcomputed features of the reported dataâthat have been demonstrated in retrospective analysis to outperform market averages. In this paper, we first show through simulation that if we could (clairvoyantly) select stocks using factors calculated on future fundamentals (via oracle), then our portfolios would far outperform a standard factor approach.  Motivated by this analysis, we train MLP and LSTM neural networks to forecast future fundamentals based on a trailing window of five years. We propose lookahead factor models to act upon these predictions,  plugging the predicted future fundamentals into traditional factors. Finally, we incorporate uncertainty estimates from both neural heteroscedastic regression and a dropout-based heuristic, demonstrating gains from adjusting our portfolios to avert risk.  In a retrospective analysis using an industry-grade stock portfolio simulator (backtester), we show simultaneous improvement in annualized return and Sharpe ratio (a common measure of risk-adjusted returns).  Specifically, the simulated annualized return for the uncertainty-aware model is 17.7% (vs 14.0% for a standard factor model) and the Sharpe ratio is 0.84 (vs 0.52).</p>

> <p>Submodular maximization has been widely studied over the past decades, mostly because of its numerous applications in real-world problems. It is well known that the standard greedy algorithm guarantees a worst-case approximation factor of 1 â 1/e when maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint. However, empirical studies show that its performance is substantially better in practice. This raises a natural question of explaining this improved performance of the greedy algorithm. In this work, we define sharpness for submodular functions as a candidate explanation for this phenomenon. The sharpness criterion is inspired by the concept of strong convexity in convex optimization. We show that the greedy algorithm provably performs better as the sharpness of the submodular function increases. This improvement ties closely to the faster convergence rates of the first order methods for strongly convex functions. Finally, we perform a computational study to empirically support our theoretical results and show that sharpness explains the greedy performance better than other justifications in the literature.</p>

> Deep models, while being extremely flexible and accurate, are surprisingly vulnerable to ``small, imperceptible&#x27;&#x27; perturbations known as adversarial attacks. While the majority of existing attacks focuses on measuring perturbations under the $\ell_p$ metric, Wasserstein distance, which takes geometry in pixel space into account, has long known to be a better metric for measuring image quality and has recently risen as a compelling alternative to the $\ell_p$ metric in adversarial attacks. However, constructing an effective attack under the Wasserstein metric is computationally much more challenging and calls for better optimization algorithms. We address this gap in two ways: (a) we develop an exact yet efficient projection operator to enable a stronger projected gradient attack; (b) we show for the first time that conditional gradient method equipped with a suitable linear minimization oracle works extremely fast under Wasserstein constraints. Our algorithms not only converge faster but also generate much stronger attacks. For instance, we decrease the accuracy of a residual network on CIFAR-10 to less than $30\%$ within a Wasserstein perturbation ball of radius $0.005$, in contrast to $65.2\%$ using the  previous state-of-the-art attack based on approximate projection.

> <p>Many cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning environments provide agents with a sparse team-based reward, as well as a dense agent-specific reward that incentivizes learning basic skills. Training policies solely on the team-based reward is often difficult due to its sparsity. Also, relying solely on the agent-specific reward is sub-optimal because it usually does not capture the team coordination objective. A common approach is to use reward shaping to construct a proxy reward by combining the individual rewards. However, this requires manual tuning for each environment. We introduce Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL), a split-level training platform that handles the two objectives separately through two optimization processes. An evolutionary algorithm maximizes the sparse team-based objective through neuroevolution on a population of teams. Concurrently, a gradient-based optimizer trains policies to only maximize the dense agent-specific rewards. The gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary population as a way of information transfer between the two optimization processes. This enables the evolutionary algorithm to use skills learned via the agent-specific rewards toward optimizing the global objective. Results demonstrate that MERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as MADDPG, on a number of difficult coordination benchmarks.</p>

> <p>A recent trend in algorithm design consists of augmenting classic data structures with machine learning models, which are better suited to reveal and exploit patterns and trends in the input data so to achieve outstanding practical improvements in space occupancy and time efficiency. <br /> This is especially known in the context of indexing data structures where, despite few attempts in evaluating their asymptotic efficiency, theoretical results are yet missing in showing that learned indexes are provably better than classic indexes, such as B+ trees and their variants. In this paper, we present the first mathematically-grounded answer to this open problem. We obtain this result by discovering and exploiting a link between the original problem and a mean exit time problem over a proper stochastic process which, we show, is related to the space and time occupancy of those learned indexes. Our general result is then specialised to five well-known distributions: Uniform, Lognormal, Pareto, Exponential, and Gamma; and it is corroborated in precision and robustness by a large set of experiments.</p>

> Ordered Weight $L_{1}$-Norms (OWL) is a new family of regularizers for high-dimensional sparse regression. However, due to the non-separable penalty, existing algorithms are either invalid or inefficient when either the size of the feature or sample is large. To address this challenge, we propose the first safe screening rule for the OWL regularized regression, which effectively avoids the updates of the parameters whose coefficients must be zeros. Moreover, we prove the proposed screening rule can be safely applied to the standard proximal gradient methods. More importantly, our screening rule can also be safely applied to stochastic proximal gradient methods in large-scale learning, which is the first safe screening rule in the stochastic setting. Experimental results on a variety of datasets show that the screening rule leads to a significant computation gain without any loss of accuracy, compared to exiting competitive algorithms.

> <p>Many computer vision applications require solving multiple tasks in real-time. A neural network can be trained to solve multiple tasks simultaneously using 'multi-task learning'. This saves computation at inference time as only a single network needs to be evaluated. Unfortunately, this often leads to inferior overall performance as task objectives compete, which consequently poses the question: which tasks should and should not be learned together in one network when employing multi-task learning? We systematically study task cooperation and competition and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing tasks are computed by different networks. Our framework offers a time-accuracy trade-off and can produce better accuracy using less inference time than not only a single large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks.</p>

> <p>We propose inertial versions of block coordinate descent methods for solving non-convex non-smooth composite optimization problems. Our methods possess three main advantages compared to current state-of-the-art accelerated first-order methods: (1) they allow using two different extrapolation points to evaluate the gradients and to add the inertial force (we will empirically show that it is more efficient than using a single extrapolation point), (2) they allow to randomly select the block of variables to update, and (3) they do not require a restarting step. We prove the subsequential convergence of the generated sequence under mild assumptions, prove the global convergence under some additional assumptions, and provide convergence rates. We deploy the proposed methods to solve non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and show that they compete favorably with the state-of-the-art NMF algorithms. Additional experiments on non-negative approximate canonical polyadic decomposition, also known as nonnegative tensor factorization, are also provided.  </p>

> <p>Despite the remarkable performance of deep neural networks on various computer vision tasks, they are known to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which makes it challenging to deploy them in real-world safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conjecture that the leading cause of this adversarial vulnerability is the distortion in the latent feature space, and provide methods to suppress them effectively. Explicitly, we define \textbf{vulnerability} for each latent feature and then propose a new loss for adversarial learning, \textbf{Vulnerability Suppression (VS)} loss, that aims to minimize the feature-level vulnerability during training. We further propose a Bayesian framework to prune features with high vulnerability to reduce both vulnerability and loss on adversarial samples. We validate our \textbf{Adversarial Neural Pruning (ANP)} method on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it not only obtains state-of-the-art adversarial robustness but also improves the performance on clean examples, using only a fraction of the parameters used by the full network. Further qualitative analysis suggests that the improvements come from the suppression of feature-level vulnerability.</p>

> <p>We present an extension to the disjoint paths problem in which additional lifted edges are introduced to provide path connectivity priors. We call the resulting optimization problem the lifted disjoint paths problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard by reduction from multicommodity flow and 3-SAT. To enable practical global optimization, we propose several classes of linear inequalities that produce a high-quality LP-relaxation. Additionally, we propose efficient cutting plane algorithms for separating the proposed linear inequalities. The lifted disjoint path problem is a natural model for multiple object tracking and allows an elegant mathematical formulation for long-range temporal interactions. Lifted edges help to prevent id switches and to re-identify persons. Our lifted disjoint paths tracker leads on all three main benchmarks of the MOT challenge, improving significantly over state-of-the-art.</p>

> <p>The point estimates of ReLU classification networks---arguably the most widely used neural network architecture---have been shown to yield arbitrarily high confidence far away from the training data. This architecture, in conjunction with a maximum a posteriori estimation scheme, is thus not calibrated nor robust. Approximate Bayesian inference has been empirically demonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks, although the theoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations is limited. We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian posterior distributions on the weights of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore, we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty on a ReLU network is ``to be a bit Bayesian''. These theoretical results validate the usage of last-layer Bayesian approximation and motivate a range of a fidelity-cost trade-off. We further validate these findings empirically via various standard experiments using common deep ReLU networks and Laplace approximations.</p>

> <p>Federated learning is a key scenario in modern large-scale machine learning where the data remains distributed over a large number of clients and the task is to learn a centralized model without transmitting the client data. The standard optimization algorithm used in this setting is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) due to its low communication cost. We obtain a tight characterization of the convergence of FedAvg and prove that heterogeneity (non-iid-ness) in the client's data results in a `drift' in the local updates resulting in poor performance.</p>  <p>As a solution, we propose a new algorithm (SCAFFOLD) which uses control variates (variance reduction) to correct for the `client drift'. We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client's data yielding even faster convergence. The latter is the first result to quantify the usefulness of local-steps in distributed optimization.</p>

> <p>We consider the setting of distributed empirical risk minimization where multiple machines compute the gradients in parallel and a centralized server updates the model parameters. In order to reduce the number of communications required to reach a given accuracy, we propose a preconditioned accelerated gradient method where the preconditioning is done by solving a local optimization problem over a subsampled dataset at the server. The convergence rate of the method depends on the square root of the relative condition number between the global and local loss functions. We estimate the relative condition number for linear prediction models by studying uniform concentration of the Hessians over a bounded domain, which allows us to derive improved convergence rates for existing preconditioned gradient methods and our accelerated method. Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the benefits of acceleration in the ill-conditioned regime.</p>

> <p>Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is a task for tagging a given text with the most relevant labels from an extremely large label set. We propose a novel deep learning method called APLC-XLNet.   Our approach fine-tunes  the  recently  released  generalized  autoregressive  pretraining model (XLNet) to learn the dense representation for the input text.   We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Label Cluster (APLC) to approximate the cross entropy loss by exploiting the  unbalanced  label  distribution  to  form  clusters that explicitly reduce the computational time. Our experiments, carried out on five benchmark datasets, show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of our method will be released publicly at GitHub.</p>

> <p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are instrumental in modelling sequential and time-series data. Yet, when using RNNs to inform decision-making, predictions by themselves are not sufficient â we also need estimates of predictive uncertainty. Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in RNNs are based predominantly on Bayesian methods; these are computationally prohibitive, and require major alterations to the RNN architecture and training. Capitalizing on ideas from classical jackknife resampling, we develop a frequentist alternative that: (a) is computationally efficient, (b) does not interfere with model training or compromise its accuracy, (c) applies to any RNN architecture, and (d) provides theoretical coverage guarantees on the estimated uncertainty intervals. Our method derives predictive uncertainty from the variability of the (jackknife) sampling distribution of the RNN outputs, which is estimated by repeatedly deleting "blocks" of (temporally-correlated) training data, and collecting the predictions of the RNN re-trained on the remaining data. To avoid computationally expensive re-training, we utilize influence functions to estimate the effect of removing training data blocks on the learned RNN parameters. Using data from a critical care medical setting, we demonstrate the utility of uncertainty quantification in sequential decision-making.</p>

> <p>A longstanding goal in the theory of deep learn-ing is to characterize the conditions under whicha given neural network architecture will be train-able, and if so, how well it might generalize tounseen data. In this work, we provide such a char-acterization in the limit of very wide and verydeep networks, for which the analysis simplifiesconsiderably.  For wide networks, the trajectoryunder gradient descent is governed by the NeuralTangent Kernel (NTK), and for deep networks,the NTK itself maintains only weak data depen-dence.  By analyzing the spectrum of the NTK,we formulate necessary conditions for trainabilityand generalization across a range of architectures,including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) andConvolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs).   Weidentify large regions of hyperparameter spacefor which networks can memorize the training setbut completely fail to generalize.  We find thatCNNs without global average pooling behave al-most identically to FCNs,  but that CNNs withpooling have markedly different and often bettergeneralization performance. A thorough empiri-cal investigation of these theoretical results showsexcellent agreement on real datasets.</p>

> Running Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in a decentralized fashion has shown promising results. In this paper we propose Moniqua, a technique that allows decentralized SGD to use quantized communication. We prove in theory that Moniqua communicates a provably bounded number of bits per iteration, while converging at the same asymptotic rate as the original algorithm does with full-precision communication. Moniqua improves upon prior works in that it (1) requires zero additional memory, (2) works with 1-bit quantization, and (3) is applicable to a variety of decentralized algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that Moniqua converges faster with respect to wall clock time than other quantized decentralized algorithms.  We also show that Moniqua is robust to very low bit-budgets, allowing  $1$-bit-per-parameter communication without compromising validation accuracy when training ResNet20 and ResNet110 on CIFAR10.

> <p>Label shift refers to the phenomenon where the prior class probability p(y) changes between the training and test distributions, while the conditional probability p(x|y) stays fixed. Label shift arises in settings like medical diagnosis, where a classifier trained to predict disease given symptoms must be adapted to scenarios where the baseline prevalence of the disease is different. Given estimates of p(y|x) from a predictive model, Saerens et al. proposed an efficient EM algorithm to correct for label shift that does not require model retraining. A limiting assumption of this algorithm is that p(y|x) is calibrated, which is not true of modern neural networks. Recently, Black Box Shift Learning (BBSL) and Regularized Learning under Label Shifts (RLLS) have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques to cope with label shift when a classifier does not output calibrated probabilities. However, both BBSL and RLLS require model retraining with importance weights, which poses challenges in practice, and neither has been benchmarked against EM. We show that by combining EM with a type of calibration we call bias-corrected calibration, we outperform both BBSL and RLLS across diverse datasets and distribution shifts. We further show that the EM objective is concave and bounded, and introduce a theoretically principled strategy for estimating source-domain priors that improves robustness to poor calibration. This work demonstrates that EM with appropriate calibration is a formidable and efficient baseline that future work in label shift adaptation should be compared with.</p>  <p>Colab notebooks reproducing experiments are available at (anonymized link): https://github.com/blindauth/labelshiftexperiments</p>

> We study a new unsupervised learning task of inferring objective functions or constraints of a multiobjective decision making model, based on a set of observed decisions. Specifically, we formulate such a learning problem as an inverse multiobjective optimization problem (IMOP) and propose its first sophisticated model with statistical guarantees. Then, we some fundamental connections between IMOP, K-means clustering and manifold learning. More precisely, we prove that every K-means clustering problem can be transformed equivalently into an IMOP, and every IMOP can be conversely interpreted as a constrained K-means clustering problem. In addition, we show that the Pareto optimal set is a piecewise continuous manifold with an intrinsic dimension of $ p-1 $ (where $ p $ is the number of objectives) under suitable conditions. Hence, IMOP can also be interpreted as a manifold learning problem. Leveraging these critical insights and connections, we propose two algorithms to solve IMOP through manifold learning and clustering. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our model and the computational efficacy of algorithms.

> This paper shows that deep learning (DL) representations of data produced by generative adversarial nets (GANs) are random vectors which fall within the class of so-called \textit{concentrated} random vectors. Further exploiting the fact that Gram matrices, of the type $G = X^\intercal X$ with $X=[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ and $x_i$ independent concentrated random vectors from a mixture model, behave asymptotically (as $n,p\to \infty$) as if the $x_i$ were drawn from a Gaussian mixture, suggests that DL representations of GAN-data can be fully described by their first two statistical moments for a wide range of standard classifiers. Our theoretical findings are validated by generating images with the BigGAN model and across different popular deep representation networks.

> <p>To acquire a new skill, humans learn better and faster if a tutor, based on their current knowledge level, informs them of how much attention they should pay to particular content or practice problems. Similarly, a machine learning model could potentially be trained better with a scorer that ``adapts'' to its current learning state and estimates the importance of each training data instance. Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging problem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a given time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the entire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a reinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In DDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training data, which can be efficiently  updated along with the main model being trained. Specifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should up-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we would finally like to perform well. Without significant computing overhead, DDS delivers strong and consistent improvements over several strong baselines on two very different tasks of machine translation and image classification.</p>

> Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, so far, such methods have been mostly analyzed from an optimization perspective, without addressing the problem of exploration, or by making strong assumptions on the interaction with the environment.  In this paper we consider model-based RL in the tabular finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 }  K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result matches previous bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions. To the best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit feedback.

> While successful in many fields, deep neural networks (DNNs) still suffer from some open problems such as bad local minima and unsatisfactory generalization performance. Despite the progresses achieved during the past several years, those difficulties have not been overcome completely and are still preventing DNNs from being more successful. In this work, we propose a novel architecture called Maximum-and-Concatenation Networks (MCN) to try eliminating bad local minima and improving generalization ability as well. MCN is a multi-layer network concatenated by a linear part and the maximum of two piecewise smooth functions, and it can approximate a wide range of functions used in practice. Remarkably, we prove that MCN has a very nice property; that is, \emph{every local minimum of an $(l+1)$-layer MCN can be better than, at least as good as, the global minima of the network consisting of its first $l$ layers}. In other words, via increasing the network depth, MCN can autonomously improve the goodness of its local minima. What is more, \emph{it is easy to plug MCN into an existing deep model to make it also have this property}. Finally, under mild conditions, we show that MCN can approximate certain continuous functions arbitrarily well with \emph{high efficiency}; that is, the covering number of MCN is much smaller than most existing DNNs such as deep ReLU. Based on this, we further provide a tight generalization bound to guarantee the inference ability of MCN when dealing with testing samples. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets confirm the effectiveness of MCN.

To our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to ensure O(âT) regret in this challenging setting; in fact, it achieves the same regret as (Rosenberg &amp; Mansour, 2019a) who consider the easier setting with full-information. Our key contributions are two-fold: a tighter confidence set for the transition function; and an optimistic loss estimator that is inversely weighted by an "upper occupancy bound". </p>

> <p>Survival Analysis and Reliability Theory are concerned with the analysis of time-to-event data, in which observations correspond to waiting times until an event of interest, such as death from a particular disease or failure of a component in a mechanical system. This type of data is unique due to the presence of censoring, a type of missing data that occurs when we do not observe the actual time of the event of interest but instead we have access to an approximation for it given by random interval in which the observation is known to belong.</p>  <p>Most traditional methods are not designed to deal with censoring, and thus we need to adapt them to censored time-to-event data. In this paper, we focus on non-parametric Goodness-of-Fit testing procedures based on combining the Stein's method and kernelized discrepancies. While for uncensored data, there is a natural way of implementing a kernelized Stein discrepancy test, for censored data there are several options, each of them with different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper we propose a collection of kernelized Stein discrepancy tests for time-to-event data, and we study each of them theoretically and empirically. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods perform better than existing tests, including previous tests based on a kernelized maximum mean discrepancy.</p>

> <p>We consider recovering a causal graph in presence of latent variables, where we seek to minimize the cost of interventions used in the recovery process. We consider two intervention cost models: (1) a linear cost model where the cost of an intervention on a subset of variables has a linear form, and (2) an identity cost model where the cost of an intervention is the same, regardless of what variables it is on, i.e., the goal is just to minimize the number of interventions. Under the linear cost model, we give an algorithm to identify the ancestral relations of the underlying causal graph, achieving within a 2-factor of the optimal intervention cost. This approximation factor can be improved to 1+eps for any eps &gt; 0, under some mild restrictions. Under the identity cost model, we bound the number of interventions needed to recover the entire causal graph, including the latent variables, using a parameterization of the causal graph  through a special type of colliders. In particular, we introduce the notion of p-colliders, that are colliders between pair of nodes arising from a specific type of conditioning in the causal graph, and provide an upper bound on the number of interventions as a function of the maximum number of p-colliders between any two nodes in the causal graph.</p>

  Chuan Guo, Tom Goldstein, Awni Hannun, Laurens van der Maaten [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/894-Metadata.json)
> <p>Good data stewardship requires removal of data at the request of the data's owner. This raises the question if and how a trained machine-learning model, which implicitly stores information about its training data, should be affected by such a removal request. Is it possible to ``remove'' data from a machine-learning model? We study this problem by defining certified removal: a very strong theoretical guarantee that a model from which data is removed cannot be distinguished from a model that never observed the data to begin with. We develop a certified-removal mechanism for linear classifiers and empirically study learning settings in which this mechanism is practical.</p>

  Abhiram Gnanasambandam, Stanley Chan [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/895-Metadata.json)
> <p>When using deep neural networks for estimating signals such as denoising images, it is generally preferred to train one network and apply it to all noise levels. The de facto training protocol to achieve this goal is to train the network with noisy samples whose noise levels are uniformly distributed across the range of interest. However, why should we allocate the samples uniformly? Can we have more training samples that are less noisy, and fewer samples that are more noisy? What is the optimal distribution? How do we obtain such optimal distribution? The goal of this paper is to address these questions. In particular, we show that the sampling problem can be formulated as a minimax risk optimization. We show that, although the neural networks are non-convex, the minimax problem itself is convex. We derive a dual ascent algorithm to determine the optimal distribution of which the convergence is guaranteed. We show that the framework is general not only to denoising but any trainable estimators where there is a range of uncertainty conditions. We demonstrate applications in image denoising, low-light reconstruction, and super-resolution.</p>

  Marc Brockschmidt [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/904-Metadata.json)
> <p>This paper presents a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) type using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). Many standard GNN variants propagate information along the edges of a graph by computing messages based only on the representation of the source of each edge. In GNN-FiLM, the representation of the target node of an edge is used to compute a transformation that can be applied to all incoming messages, allowing feature-wise modulation of the passed information.</p>  <p>Different GNN architectures are compared in extensive experiments on three tasks from the literature, using re-implementations of many baseline methods. Hyperparameters for all methods were found using extensive search, yielding somewhat surprising results: differences between state of the art models are much smaller than reported in the literature and well-known simple baselines that are often not compared to perform better than recently proposed GNN variants. Nonetheless, GNN-FiLM outperforms these methods on a regression task on molecular graphs and performs competitively on other tasks.</p>

> <p>We introduce a new class of interdomain variational Gaussian processes (GP) where data is mapped onto the unit hypersphere in order to use spherical harmonic representations. Our inference scheme is comparable to variational Fourier features, but it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and leads to diagonal covariance matrices between inducing variables. This enables a speed-up in inference, because it bypasses the need to invert large covariance matrices. Our experiments show that our model is able to fit a regression model for a dataset with 6 million entries two orders of magnitude faster compared to standard sparse GPs, while retaining state of the art accuracy. We also demonstrate competitive performance on classification with non-conjugate likelihoods.</p>

> <p>Coagent policy gradient algorithms (CPGAs) are reinforcement learning algorithms for training a class of stochastic neural networks called coagent networks. In this work, we prove that CPGAs converge to locally optimal policies. Additionally, we extend prior theory to encompass asynchronous and recurrent coagent networks. These extensions facilitate the straightforward design and analysis of hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms like the option-critic, and eliminate the need for complex derivations of customized learning rules for these algorithms.</p>

> <p>The empirical performance of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) is significantly inferior to discrete-layer models on benchmark tasks (e.g. image classification). We demonstrate an explanation is the inaccuracy of existing gradient estimation methods: the adjoint method has numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method suffers from a redundantly deep computation graph. We propose the Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward- mode trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods. Furthermore, NODE with ACA can incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy.</p>

> Off-policy policy estimators that use importance sampling (IS) can suffer from high variance in long-horizon domains, and there has been particular excitement over new IS methods that leverage the structure of Markov decision processes. We analyze the variance of the most popular approaches through the viewpoint of conditional Monte Carlo. Surprisingly, we find that in finite horizon MDPs there is no strict variance reduction of per-decision importance sampling or stationary importance sampling, comparing with vanilla importance sampling. We then provide sufficient conditions under which the per-decision or stationary estimators will provably reduce the variance over importance sampling with finite horizons. For the asymptotic (in terms of horizon $T$) case, we develop upper and lower bounds on the variance of those estimators which yields sufficient conditions under which there exists an exponential v.s. polynomial gap between the variance of importance sampling and that of the per-decision or stationary estimators. These results help advance our understanding of if and when new types of IS estimators will improve the accuracy of off-policy estimation.

> <p>In this work, we investigate the application of Taylor expansions in reinforcement learning. In particular, we propose Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization, a policy optimization formalism that generalizes prior work as a first-order special case. We also show that Taylor expansions intimately relate to off-policy evaluation. Finally, we show that this new formulation entails modifications which  improve the performance of several state-of-the-art distributed algorithms.</p>

> <p>Integer programming is a general optimization framework with a wide variety of applications, e.g., in scheduling, production planning, and graph optimization. As Integer Programs (IPs) model many provably hard to solve problems, modern IP solvers rely on heuristics. These heuristics are often human-designed, and tuned over time using experience and data.  The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane Method.  This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show that our trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial IP solvers.</p>

> <p>Safe reinforcement learning has been a promising approach for optimizing the policy of an agent that operates in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, SNO-MDP, that explores and optimizes Markov decision processes under unknown safety constraints. Specifically, we take a step-wise approach for optimizing safety and cumulative reward.  In our method, the agent first learns safety constraints by expanding the safe region, and then optimizes the cumulative reward in the certified safe region. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the satisfaction of the safety constraint and the near-optimality of the cumulative reward under proper regularity assumptions. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SNO-MDP through two experiments: one uses a synthetic data in a new, openly-available environment named GP-Safety-Gym, and the other simulates Mars surface exploration by using real observation data.</p>

> In real world,  our datasets often contain outliers. Moreover, the outliers can seriously affect the final machine learning result. Most existing algorithms for handling outliers take high time complexities ({\em e.g.} quadratic or cubic complexity). {\em Coreset} is a popular approach for compressing data so as to speed up the optimization algorithms. However, the current coreset methods cannot be easily extended to handle the case with outliers. In this paper, we propose a new variant of coreset technique,  {\em layered sampling}, to deal with two fundamental robust optimization problems: {\em $k$-median/means clustering with outliers} and {\em linear regression with outliers}. This new coreset method is in particular suitable to speed up the iterative algorithms (which often improve the solution within a local range) for those robust optimization problems. Moreover, our method is easy to be implemented in practice. We expect that our framework of layered sampling will be applicable to  other robust optimization problems.

> <p>We introduce a new way of learning to encode position information for non-recurrent models, such as Transformer models. Unlike RNN and LSTM, which contain inductive bias by loading the input tokens sequentially, non-recurrent models are less sensitive to position. The main reason is that position information among input units is not encoded inherently, i.e., they are permutation equivalent, this problem justifies why all of the existing models are accompanied by position encoding/embedding layer at the input. However, this solution has clear limitations: the sinusoidal position encoding is not flexible enough as it is manually designed and does not contain any learnable parameters, whereas the position embedding restricts the maximum length of input sequences. It is thus desirable to design a new position layer that contains learnable parameters to adjust to different datasets and different architectures. At the same time, we would also like it to extrapolate in accordance with the variable length of inputs. In our proposed solution, we borrow from the recent Neural ODE approach, which may be viewed as a versatile continuous version of a ResNet. This model is capable of modeling many kinds of dynamical systems. We model the evolution of encoded results along position index by such a dynamical system, thereby overcoming the above limitations of existing methods. We evaluate our new position layers on a variety of neural machine translation and language understanding tasks, the experimental results show consistent improvements over the baselines.</p>

> <p>The LSTM network was proposed to overcome the difficulty in learning long-term dependence, and has made significant advancements in applications. With its success and drawbacks in mind, we raise the question - do RNN and LSTM have long memory? We answer it partially by proving that RNN and LSTM do not have long memory from a time series perspective. Since the term "long memory" is still not well-defined for a network, we propose a new definition for long memory network. To verify our theory, we make minimal modifications to RNN and LSTM and convert them to long memory networks, and illustrate their superiority in modeling long-term dependence of various datasets.</p>

> <p>In the current era of personalized recommendation, one major interest is to develop an optimal individualized decision rule that assigns individuals with the best treatment option according to their covariates. Estimation of optimal decision rules (ODR) has been extensively investigated recently, however, at present, no testing procedure is proposed to verify whether these ODRs are significantly better than the naive decision rule that always assigning individuals to a fixed treatment option. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure for detecting the existence of an ODR that is better than the naive decision rule under the randomized trials. We construct the proposed test based on the difference of estimated value functions using the augmented inverse probability weighted method. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses are established. Based on the established asymptotic distributions, we further develop a sample size calculation formula for testing the existence of an ODR in designing A/B tests. Extensive simulations and a real data application to a schizophrenia clinical trial data are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed methods.</p>

  Liqun Chen, Zhe Gan, Yu Cheng, Linjie Li, Lawrence Carin, Jingjing Liu [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/971-Metadata.json)
> <p>Cross-domain alignment between two sets of entities (e.g., objects in an image, words in a sentence) is fundamental to both computer vision and natural language processing. Existing methods mainly focus on designing advanced attention mechanisms to simulate soft alignment, where no training signals are provided to explicitly encourage alignment. Plus, the learned attention matrices are often dense and difficult to interpret. We propose Graph Optimal Transport (GOT), a principled framework that builds upon recent advances in Optimal Transport (OT). In GOT, cross-domain alignment is formulated as a graph matching problem, by representing entities as a dynamically-constructed graph. Two types of OT distances are considered: (i) Wasserstein distance (WD) for node (entity) matching; and (ii) Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) for edge (structure) matching. Both WD and GWD can be incorporated into existing neural network models, effectively acting as a drop-in regularizer. <br /> The inferred transport plan also yields sparse and self-normalized alignment, enhancing the interpretability of the learned model. Experiments show consistent outperformance of GOT over baselines across a wide range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, image captioning, machine translation, and text summarization. </p>

> Recent interest in invertible models and normalizing flows has resulted in new architectures that ensure invertibility of the network model. Neural ODEs and i-ResNets are two recent techniques for constructing models that are invertible, but it is unclear if they can be used to approximate any continuous invertible mapping. Here, we show that out of the box, both of these architectures are limited in their approximation capabilities. We then show how to overcome this limitation: we prove that any homeomorphism on a $p$-dimensional Euclidean space can be approximated by a Neural ODE or an i-ResNet operating on a $2p$-dimensional Euclidean space. We conclude by showing that capping a Neural ODE or an i-ResNet with a single linear layer is sufficient to turn the model into a universal approximator for non-invertible continuous functions.

> <p>Automating algorithm configuration is growing increasingly necessary as algorithms come with more and more tunable parameters. It is common to tune parameters using machine learning, optimizing algorithmic performance (runtime or solution quality, for example) using a training set of problem instances from the specific domain at hand. We investigate a fundamental question about these techniques: how large should the training set be to ensure that a parameterâs average empirical performance over the training set is close to its expected, future performance? We answer this question for algorithm configuration problems that exhibit a widely-applicable structure: the algorithm's performance as a function of its parameters can be approximated by a âsimpleâ function. We show that if this approximation holds under the Lâ-norm, we can provide strong sample complexity bounds, but if the approximation holds only under the Lp-norm for p &lt; â, it is not possible to provide meaningful sample complexity bounds in the worst case. We empirically evaluate our bounds in the context of integer programming, obtaining sample complexity bounds that are up to 700 times smaller than the previously best-known bounds.</p>

> Machine Teaching studies how efficiently a Teacher  can guide a Learner to a target hypothesis. We focus on the model of Machine Teaching with a black box learner introduced in [Dasgupta et al., ICML 2019], where the teaching is done  interactively   without having any knowledge of the Learner&#x27;s   algorithm and  class of hypotheses, apart from the fact that it contains the target hypothesis $h^*$.   We first refine some existing results for this   model and,  then, we study new variants of it. Motivated  by the realistic possibility that  $h^*$ is not available to the learner, we consider the case where the teacher can only aim at having the learner converge to a best available approximation of $h^*$. We also consider weaker black box learners, where, in each round, the choice of the consistent hypothesis returned to the Teacher is not adversarial, and in particular, we show that better provable bounds can be obtained for a type of Learner  that moves to the next  hypothesis smoothly, preferring hypotheses that are  close  to the current one; and for another type of Learner that can provide to the Teacher hypotheses chosen at random among those consistent with the examples received so far.   Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of  our basic interactive teacher on real datasets.

> <p>For an explanation of a deep learning model to be effective, it must provide both insight into a model and suggest a corresponding action in order to achieve some objective. Too often, the litany of proposed explainable deep learning methods stop at the first step, providing practitioners with insight into a model, but no way to act on it. In this paper, we propose contextual decomposition explanation penalization (CDEP), a method which enables practitioners to leverage existing explanation methods to increase the predictive accuracy of a deep learning model. In particular, when shown that a model has incorrectly assigned importance to some features, CDEP enables practitioners to correct these errors by inserting domain knowledge into the model  via explanations. We demonstrate the ability of CDEP to increase performance on an array of toy and real datasets.</p>

> <p>Machine learning models are not static and may need to be retrained on slightly different datasets, for instance, with the addition or deletion of a set of datapoints. This has many applications, including privacy, robustness, bias reduction, and uncertainty quantification. However, it is expensive to retrain models from scratch. To address this problem, we propose the DeltaGrad algorithm for rapidly retraining machine learning models based on information cached during the training phase. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for the effectiveness of DeltaGrad, and show that it compares favorably to the state of the art.</p>

  Pierre Bellec, Dana Yang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1015-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1015-Supplemental.zip)
> We consider the problem of selecting the best estimator among a family of Tikhonov regularized estimators, or, alternatively, to select a linear combination of these regularizers that is as good as the best regularizer in the family. Our theory reveals that if the Tikhonov regularizers share the same penalty matrix with different tuning parameters, a convex procedure based on $Q$-aggregation achieves the mean square error of the best estimator, up to a small error term no larger than $C\sigma^2$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise level and $C&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. Remarkably, the error term does not depend on the penalty matrix or the number of estimators as long as they share the same penalty matrix, i.e., it applies to any grid of tuning parameters, no matter how large the cardinality of the grid is. This reveals the surprising &quot;cost-free&quot; nature of optimally tuning Tikhonov regularizers, in striking contrast with the existing literature on aggregation of estimators where one typically has to pay a cost of $\sigma^2\log(M)$ where $M$ is the number of estimators in the family. The result holds, more generally, for any family of ordered linear smoothers. This encompasses Ridge regression as well as Principal Component Regression. The result is extended to the problem of tuning Tikhonov regularizers with different penalty matrices.

> <p>This paper proposes a new framework for providing approximation guarantees of local search algorithms. Local search is a basic algorithm design technique and is widely used for various combinatorial optimization problems. To analyze local search algorithms for set function maximization, we propose a new notion called \textit{localizability} of set functions, which measures how effective local improvement is. Moreover, we provide approximation guarantees of standard local search algorithms under various combinatorial constraints in terms of localizability. The main application of our framework is sparse optimization, for which we show that restricted strong concavity and restricted smoothness of the objective function imply localizability, and further develop accelerated versions of local search algorithms. We conduct experiments in sparse regression and structure learning of graphical models to confirm the practical efficiency of the proposed local search algorithms.</p>

> <p>Recently there are a considerable amount of work devoted to the study of the algorithm stability and  generalization for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, the existing stability analysis requires to impose restrictive assumptions on the boundedness of gradients, strong smoothness and convexity of loss functions. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of stability and generalization for SGD by substantially relaxing these assumptions. Firstly, we establish stability and generalization for SGD by removing the existing bounded gradient assumptions. The key idea is the introduction of a new stability measure called  on-average model stability, for which we develop novel bounds controlled by the risks of SGD iterates. This yields  generalization bounds depending on the behavior of the best model, and leads to the first-ever-known fast bounds in the low-noise setting using stability approach. Secondly, the smoothness assumption is relaxed by considering loss functions with Holder continuous gradients for which we show that optimal bounds are still achieved by balancing computation and stability. Finally, we study learning problems with (strongly) convex objectives but non-convex loss functions, and provide applications where the existing stability bounds fail.</p>

> <p>\emph{Dense subgraph discovery} aims to find a dense component in edge-weighted graphs. This is a fundamental graph-mining task with a variety of applications and thus has received much attention recently. Although most existing methods assume that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption is not necessarily valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning problem for dense subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge subsets rather than only single edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights in a queried subset. For this problem, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution with high probability. Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more scalable algorithm with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.</p>

> The causal relationships among a set of random variables are commonly represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where there is a directed edge from variable $X$ to variable $Y$ if $X$ is a direct cause of $Y$. From the purely observational data, the true causal graph can be identified up to a Markov Equivalence Class (MEC), which is a set of DAGs with the same conditional independencies between the variables. The size of an MEC is a measure of complexity for recovering the true causal graph by performing interventions. We propose a method for efficient iteration over possible MECs given intervention results. We utilize the proposed method for computing MEC sizes and experiment design in active and passive learning settings. Compared to previous work for computing the size of MEC, our proposed algorithm reduces the time complexity by a factor of $O(n)$ for sparse graphs where $n$ is the number of variables in the system. Additionally, integrating our approach with dynamic programming, we design an optimal algorithm for passive experiment design. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms for both computing the size of MEC and experiment design outperform the state of the art.

> <p>Modern generative models are usually designed to match target distributions directly in the data space, where the intrinsic dimension of data can be much lower than the ambient dimension. We argue that this discrepancy may contribute to the difficulties in training generative models. We therefore propose to map both the generated and target distributions to the latent space using the encoder of a standard autoencoder, and train the generator (or decoder) to match the target distribution in the latent space. Specifically, we enforce the consistency in both the data space and the latent space with theoretically justified data and latent reconstruction losses. The resulting generative model, which we call a perceptual generative autoencoder (PGA), is then trained with a maximum likelihood or variational autoencoder (VAE) objective. With maximum likelihood, PGAs generalize the idea of reversible generative models to unrestricted neural network architectures and arbitrary number of latent dimensions. When combined with VAEs, PGAs substantially improve over the baseline VAEs in terms of sample quality. Compared to other autoencoder-based generative models using simple priors, PGAs achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR-10 and CelebA.</p>

> <p>The problem of adversarial examples has shown that modern Neural Network (NN) models could be rather fragile. Among the most promising techniques to solve the problem, one is to require the model to be epsilon-adversarially robust (AR); that is, to require the model not to change predicted labels when any given input examples are perturbed within a certain range. However, it is observed that such methods would lead to standard performance degradation, i.e., the degradation on natural examples. In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization perspective. We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t. perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard performance. Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that build AR into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.</p>

> <p>We prove quantitative convergence rates at which discrete Langevin-like processes converge to the invariant distribution of a related stochastic differential equation. We study the setup where the additive noise can be non-Gaussian and state-dependent and the potential function can be non-convex. We show that the key properties of these processes depend on the potential function and the second moment of the additive noise. We apply our theoretical findings to studying the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for non-convex problems and corroborate them with experiments using SGD to train deep neural networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>

> <p>The role concept provides a useful tool to design and understand complex multi-agent systems, which allows agents with a similar role to share similar behaviors. However, existing role-based methods use prior domain knowledge and predefine role structures and behaviors. In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides flexibility and adaptability, but less efficiency in complex tasks. In this paper, we synergize these two paradigms and propose a role-oriented MARL framework (ROMA). In this framework, roles are emergent, and agents with similar roles tend to share their learning to be specialized on certain sub-tasks. To this end, we construct a stochastic role embedding space by introducing two novel regularizers and conditioning individual policies on roles. Experiments show that our method can learn dynamic, versatile, identifiable, and specialized roles, which help our method push forward the state of the art on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.

> <p>In this work we formulate and formally characterize group fairness as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each sensitive group risk is a separate objective. We propose a fairness criterion where a classifier achieves minimax risk and is Pareto-efficient w.r.t. all groups, avoiding unnecessary harm, and can lead to the best zero-gap model if policy dictates so. We provide a simple optimization algorithm compatible with deep neural networks to satisfy these constraints. Since our method does not require test-time access to sensitive attributes, it can be applied to reduce worst-case classification errors between outcomes in unbalanced classification problems. We test the proposed methodology on real case-studies of predicting income, ICU patient mortality, skin lesions classification, and assessing credit risk, demonstrating how our framework compares favorably to other approaches.</p>

  Jinzhi Bu, David Simchi-Levi, Yunzong Xu [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1090-Metadata.json)
> <p>This paper investigates the impact of pre-existing offline data on online learning, in the context of dynamic pricing. We study a single-product dynamic pricing problem over a selling horizon of T periods. The demand in each period is determined by the price of the product according to a linear demand model with unknown parameters. We assume that the seller already has some pre-existing offline data before the start of the selling horizon. The seller wants to utilize both the pre-existing offline data and the sequential online data to minimize the regret of the online learning process. We characterize the joint effect of the size, location and dispersion of the offline data on the optimal regret of the online learning process. Our results reveal surprising transformations of the optimal regret rate with respect to the size of the offline data, which we refer to as phase transitions. In addition, our results demonstrate that the location and dispersion of the offline data also have an intrinsic effect on the optimal regret, and we quantify this effect via the inverse-square law.</p>

> <p>Black-Box Optimization (BBO) methods can find optimal policies for systems that interact with complex environments with no analytical representation. As such, they are of interest in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains. Yet classical BBO methods fall short in high-dimensional non-convex problems. They are thus often overlooked in real-world AI tasks. Here we present a BBO method, termed Explicit Gradient Learning (EGL), that is designed to optimize high-dimensional ill-behaved functions. We derive EGL by finding weak spots in methods that fit the objective function with a parametric Neural Network (NN) model and obtain the gradient signal by calculating the parametric gradient. Instead of fitting the function, EGL trains a NN to estimate the objective gradient directly. We prove the convergence of EGL to a stationary point and its robustness in the optimization of integrable functions. We evaluate EGL and achieve state-of-the-art results in two challenging problems: (1) the COCO test suite against an assortment of standard BBO methods; and (2) in a high-dimensional non-convex image generation task.</p>

> <p>Modern recommendation and notification systems must be robust to data imbalance, limitations on the number of recommendations/notifications, and heterogeneous engagement profiles across users. The pAp@k metric, which combines the partial-AUC and the precision@k metrics, was recently proposed to evaluate such recommendation systems and has been used in real-world deployments. Conceptually, pAp@k measures the probability of correctly ranking a top-ranked positive instance over top-ranked negative instances. Due to the combinatorial aspect surfaced by top-ranked points, little is known about the characteristics and optimization methods of pAp@k. In this paper, we analyze the learning-theoretic properties of pAp@k and propose novel surrogates that are consistent under certain data regularity conditions. We then provide gradient descent based algorithms to optimize the surrogates directly. Our analysis and experimental evaluation suggest that pAp@k indeed exhibits a certain dual behavior with respect to partial-AUC and precision@k. Moreover, the proposed methods outperform all the baselines in various applications. Taken together, our results motivate the use of pAp@k for large-scale recommender systems.</p>

> <p>Attribution methods aim to explain a neural network's prediction by highlighting the most relevant image areas. A popular approach is to backpropagate (BP) a custom relevance score using modified rules, rather than the gradient. We analyze an extensive set of modified BP methods: Deep Taylor Decomposition, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Excitation BP, PatternAttribution, DeepLIFT, Deconv, RectGrad, and Guided BP. We find empirically that the explanations of all mentioned methods, except for DeepLIFT, are independent of the parameters of later layers. We provide theoretical insights for this surprising behavior and also analyze why DeepLIFT does not suffer from this limitation. Empirically, we measure how information of later layers is ignored by using our new metric, cosine similarity convergence (CSC). The paper provides a framework to assess the faithfulness of new and existing modified BP methods theoretically and empirically.</p>

> We consider the problem of online adaptive control of the linear quadratic regulator, where the true system parameters are unknown. We prove new upper and lower bounds demonstrating that the optimal regret scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}({\sqrt{d_{\mathbf{u}}^2 d_{\mathbf{x}} T}})$, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $d_{\mathbf{u}}$ is the dimension of the input space, and $d_{\mathbf{x}}$ is the dimension of the system state.  Notably, our lower bounds rule out the possibility of a $\mathrm{poly}(\log{}T)$-regret algorithm, which has been conjectured due to the apparent strong convexity of the problem. Our upper bounds are attained by a simple variant of \emph{certainty equivalence control}, where the learner selects control inputs according to  the optimal controller for their estimate of the system while injecting exploratory random noise (Mania et al. 2019).  Central to our upper and lower bounds is a new approach for controlling perturbations of Riccati equations, which we call the \emph{self-bounding ODE method}. The approach enables regret upper bounds which hold for \emph{any stabilizable instance}, require no foreknowledge of the system except for a single stabilizing controller, and scale with natural control-theoretic quantities.

> <p>Learning controllable and generalizable representation of multivariate data with desired structural properties remains a fundamental problem in machine learning. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning generative models with various underlying structures in the latent space. We represent the inductive bias in the form of mask variables to model the dependency structure in the graphical model and extend the theory of multivariate information bottleneck to enforce it. Our model provides a principled approach to learn a set of semantically meaningful latent factors that reflect various types of desired structures like capturing correlation or encoding invariance, while also offering the flexibility to automatically estimate the dependency structure from data. We show that our framework unifies many existing generative models and can be applied to a variety of tasks including multi-modal data modeling, algorithmic fairness, and invariant risk minimization.</p>

> <p>Efficient exploration remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning, especially for those tasks where rewards from environments are sparse.  In this work, we introduce an exploration approach based on a novel implicit generative modeling algorithm to estimate a Bayesian uncertainty of the agent's belief of the environment dynamics. Each random draw from our generative model is a neural network that instantiates the dynamic function, hence multiple draws would approximate the posterior, and the variance in the predictions based on this posterior is used as an intrinsic reward for exploration. We design a training algorithm for our generative model based on the amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this exploration algorithm in both pure exploration tasks and a downstream task, comparing with state-of-the-art intrinsic reward-based exploration approaches, including two recent approaches based on an ensemble of dynamic models. In challenging exploration tasks, our implicit generative model consistently outperforms competing approaches regarding data efficiency in exploration.</p>

> <p>Many real-world control problems involve conflicting objectives where we desire a dense and high-quality set of control policies that are optimal for different objective preferences (called Pareto-optimal). While extensive research in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) has been conducted to tackle such problems, multi-objective optimization for complex continuous robot control is still under-explored. In this work, we propose an efficient evolutionary learning algorithm to find the Pareto set approximation for continuous robot control problems, by extending a state-of-the-art RL algorithm and presenting a novel prediction model to guide the learning process. In addition to efficiently discovering the individual policies on the Pareto front, we construct a continuous set of Pareto-optimal solutions by Pareto analysis and interpolation. Furthermore, we design six multi-objective RL environments with continuous action space, which is the first benchmark platform to evaluate MORL algorithms on various robot control problems. We test the previous methods on the proposed benchmark problems, and the experiments show that our approach is able to find a much denser and higher-quality set of Pareto policies than the existing algorithms.</p>

> Hypothesis testing of random networks is an emerging area of modern research, especially in the high-dimensional regime, where the  number of samples is smaller or comparable to the size of the graph.  In this paper we consider the goodness-of-fit testing problem for large inhomogeneous random (IER) graphs, where given a (known) reference symmetric matrix $Q \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$ and $m$ independent samples from an IER graph given by an unknown  symmetric matrix $P \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$, the goal is to test the hypothesis $P=Q$ versus $||P-Q|| \geq \varepsilon$, where $||\cdot||$ is some specified norm on symmetric matrices. Building on recent related work on two-sample testing for IER graphs, we derive the optimal minimax sample complexities for the goodness-of-fit problem in various natural norms, such as the Frobenius norm and the operator norm. We also propose practical implementations of natural test statistics, using their asymptotic distributions and through the parametric bootstrap. We compare the performances of the different tests in simulations, and show that the proposed  tests outperform the baseline tests across various natural random graphs models.

> <p>We study few-shot supervised domain adaptation (DA) for regression problems, where only a few labeled target domain data and many labeled source domain data are available. Many of the current DA methods base their transfer assumptions on either parametrized distribution shift or apparent distribution similarities, e.g., identical conditionals or small distributional discrepancies. However, these assumptions may preclude the possibility of adaptation from intricately shifted and apparently very different distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose mechanism transfer, a meta-distributional scenario in which a data generating mechanism is invariant among domains. This transfer assumption can accommodate nonparametric shifts resulting in apparently different distributions while providing a solid statistical basis for DA. We take the structural equations in causal modeling as an example and propose a novel DA method, which is shown to be useful both theoretically and experimentally. Our method can be seen as the first attempt to fully leverage the invariance of structural causal models for DA.</p>

> <p>Adversarial Multi-task Representation Learning (AMTRL) methods are able to boost the performance of Multi-task Representation Learning (MTRL) models. However, the theoretical mechanism behind AMTRL is less investigated. To fill this gap, we study the generalization error bound of AMTRL through the lens of Lagrangian duality . Based on the duality, we proposed an novel adaptive AMTRL algorithm which improves the performance of original AMTRL methods. The extensive experiments back up our theoretical analysis and validate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.</p>

> In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming algorithms for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for non-monotone submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the currently tightest deterministic approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to a $k$-matchoid constraint. Moreover, we propose the first streaming algorithms for monotone submodular maximization subject to $k$-extendible and $k$-system constraints. Together with our proposed reduction, we obtain $O(k\log k)$ and $O(k^2\log k)$ approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively. We extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the existing work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum independent set in randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over social networks, movie recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter data summarization.

> <p>Recently, gradient-based methods have been developed for Bi-Level Programmings (BLPs) in learning and vision fields. The successes of these methods heavily rely on the simplification that for each fixed upper-level variable, the lower-level solution is a singleton (i.e., Lower-Level Singleton, LLS). However, LLS is usually too restrictive to be satisfied in real-world complex scenarios. This paper first presents a counter-example to illustrate the invalidation of those existing gradient-based bi-level schemes in the absence of the LLS condition. To address this critical issue, a new method, named Bi-level Descent Aggregation (BDA) is proposed, aiming to broaden the application horizon of first-order schemes for BLPs. In particular, by investigating BLPs from the view point of optimistic bi-level, BDA establishes a generic algorithmic framework. In our strategy, the aggregation of hierarchical objective information helps to produce flexible bi-level iteration schemes. Our theoretical investigations prove the strict convergence of BDA for general BLPs without the LLS condition. We also show that BDA is indeed compatible to a verify of particular first-order computation modules. Additionally, as an interesting byproduct, we improve those conventional first-order bi-level schemes under the LLS simplification. Particularly, we establish their convergences with weaker assumptions. Extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BDA for different tasks, including hyper-parameter optimization and meta learning.</p>

> <p>Submodular function minimization is well studied, and existing algorithms solve it exactly or up to arbitrary accuracy. However, in many applications, such as structured sparse learning, and batch Bayesian optimization, the objective function is not exactly submodular, but close. In this case, no theoretical guarantees exist. Indeed, submodular minimization algorithms rely on intricate connections between submodularity and convexity. We show how these relations can be extended to obtain approximation guarantees for minimizing non-submodular functions, characterized by how close the function is to submodular. We also extend this result to noisy function evaluations. Our approximation results are the first for minimizing non-submodular functions, and are optimal, as established by our matching lower bound.</p>

> <p>Incorporating symbolic reasoning into machine learning algorithms is a promising approach to improve performance on learning tasks that require logical reasoning. We study the problem of generating a programmatic variant of referring expressions that we call referring relational programs. In particular, given a symbolic representation of an image and a target object in that image, the goal is to generate a relational program that uniquely identifies the target object in terms of its attributes and its relations to other objects in the image. We propose a neurosymbolic program synthesis algorithm that combines a policy neural network with enumerative search to generate such relational programs. The policy neural network employs a program interpreter that provides immediate feedback on the consequences of the decisions made by the policy, and also takes into account the uncertainty in the symbolic representation of the image. We evaluate our algorithm on challenging benchmarks based on the CLEVR dataset, and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms several baselines.</p>

> We give a row sampling algorithm for the quantile loss function with sample complexity nearly linear in the dimensionality of the data, improving upon the previous best algorithm whose sampling complexity has at least cubic dependence on the dimensionality. Based upon our row sampling algorithm, we give the fastest known algorithm for quantile regression and a graph sparsification algorithm for balanced directed graphs. Our main technical contribution is to show that Lewis weights sampling, which has been used in row sampling algorithms for $\ell_p$ norms, can also be applied in row sampling algorithms for a variety of loss functions. We complement our theoretical results by experiments to demonstrate the practicality of our approach.

> <p>Recent work has shown generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate highly realistic images, that are often indistinguishable (by humans) from real images. Most images so generated are not contained in the training dataset, suggesting potential for augmenting training sets with GAN-generated data. While this scenario is of particular relevance when there are limited data available, there is still the issue of training the GAN itself based on that limited data. To facilitate this, we leverage existing GAN models pretrained on large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) to introduce additional knowledge (which may not exist within the limited data), following the concept of transfer learning. Demonstrated by natural-image generation, we reveal that low-level filters (those close to observations) of both the generator and discriminator of pretrained GANs can be transferred to facilitate generation in a perceptually-distinct target domain with limited training data. To further adapt the transferred filters to the target domain, we propose adaptive filter modulation (AdaFM). An extensive set of experiments is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on generation with limited data.</p>

> Despite remarkable success in practice, modern machine learning models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that make human-imperceptible perturbations to the data, but result in serious and potentially dangerous prediction errors. To address this issue, practitioners often use adversarial training to learn models that are robust against such attacks at the cost of higher generalization error on unperturbed test sets. The conventional wisdom is that more training data should shrink the gap between the generalization error of adversarially-trained models and standard models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers for both Gaussian and Bernoulli models under $\ell_\infty$ attacks, and we prove that more data may actually increase this gap. Furthermore, our theoretical results identify if and when additional data will finally begin to shrink the gap. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that our results also hold for linear regression models, which may indicate that this phenomenon occurs more broadly.

> Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning allows one to evaluate novel decision policies without needing to conduct exploration, which is often costly or otherwise infeasible. We consider for the first time the semiparametric efficiency limits of OPE in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where actions, rewards, and states are memoryless. We show existing OPE estimators may fail to be efficient in this setting. We develop a new estimator based on cross-fold estimation of $q$-functions and marginalized density ratios, which we term double reinforcement learning (DRL). We show that DRL is efficient when both components are estimated at fourth-root rates and is also doubly robust when only one component is consistent. We investigate these properties empirically and demonstrate the performance benefits due to harnessing memorylessness.

> <p>Policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning update policy parameters by taking steps in the direction of an estimated gradient of policy value. In this paper, we consider the efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data, where the estimation is particularly non-trivial. We derive the asymptotic lower bound on the feasible mean-squared error in both Markov and non-Markov decision processes and show that existing estimators fail to achieve it in general settings. We propose a meta-algorithm that achieves the lower bound without any parametric assumptions and exhibits a unique 4-way double robustness property. We discuss how to estimate nuisances that the algorithm relies on. Finally, we establish guarantees at the rate at which we approach a stationary point when we take steps in the direction of our new estimated policy gradient.</p>

  Xuxi Chen, Wuyang Chen, Tianlong Chen, Ye Yuan, Chen Gong, Kewei Chen, Zhangyang Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1182-Metadata.json)
> <p>Many real-world applications have to tackle the Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, i.e., learning binary classifiers from a large amount of unlabeled data and a few labeled positive examples. While current state-of-the-art methods employ importance reweighting to design various biased or unbiased risk estimators, they completely ignored the learning capability of the model itself, which could provide reliable supervision. This motivates us to propose a novel Self-PU learning framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and self-training. Self-PU highlights three ``self''-oriented building blocks: a self-paced training algorithm that adaptively discovers and augments confident positive/negative examples as the training proceeds; a self-reweighted, instance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces teacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR10), which compare favorably against the latest competitors. Moreover, we study a real-world application of PU learning, i.e., classifying brain images of Alzheimer's Disease. Self-PU obtains significantly improved results on the renowned Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database over existing methods.</p>

> <p>Self-supervision as an emerging learning technique has been employed to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for more transferrable, generalizable, and robust representation learning of image data.  Its introduction to graph convolutional networks (GCNs) operating on graph data is however rarely explored.  In this study, we report the first systematic exploration and assessment of incorporating self-supervision into  GCNs.  We first elaborate three mechanisms to incorporate self-supervision into GCNs, analyze the limitations of pretraining &amp; finetuning and self-training, and proceed to focus on multi-task learning. Moreover, we design three novel self-supervised learning tasks for GCNs with both theoretical rationales and numerical comparisons.  Lastly, we further integrate multi-task self-supervision into graph adversarial training. Our results show that, with properly designed task forms and incorporation mechanisms, self-supervision benefits GCNs in gaining more generalizability and robustness. </p>

> In this paper, we consider the problem of designing  Differentially Private (DP) algorithms for Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) on heavy-tailed data. The irregularity of such data violates some key  assumptions used in almost all existing DP-SCO and DP-ERM methods, resulting in failure to provide the DP guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework, which has an excess population risk of  $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon^4})$ (after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the  \textit{expected} excess population risk to $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{ n\epsilon^2 })$. To lift these additional conditions, we also    provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based scheme to achieve  excess population risks of    $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ and $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^\frac{2}{3}}{(n\epsilon^2)^\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly convex and general convex loss functions, respectively, \textit{with high probability}. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our algorithms can effectively deal with the challenges caused by data irregularity.

> <p>We propose an accelerated version of stochastic variance reduced coordinate descent -- ASVRCD. As other variance reduced coordinate descent methods such as SEGA or SVRCD, our method can deal with problems that include a non-separable and non-smooth regularizer, while accessing a random block of partial derivatives in each iteration only. However, ASVRCD incorporates Nesterov's momentum, which offers favorable iteration complexity guarantees over both  SEGA and SVRCD. As a by-product of our theory, we show that a variant of Katyusha (Allen-Zhu, 2017) is a specific case of ASVRCD, recovering the optimal oracle complexity for the finite sum objective.</p>

> In this paper, we propose a new randomized second-order optimization algorithm---Stochastic Subspace Cubic Newton (SSCN)---for minimizing a high dimensional convex function $f$. Our method can be seen both as a {\em stochastic} extension of the cubically-regularized Newton method of Nesterov and Polyak (2006), and a {\em second-order} enhancement of stochastic subspace descent of Kozak et al. (2019). We prove that as we vary the minibatch size, the global convergence rate of SSCN interpolates between the rate of stochastic coordinate descent (CD) and the rate of cubic regularized Newton, thus giving new insights into the connection between first and second-order methods. Remarkably, the local convergence rate of SSCN matches the rate of stochastic subspace descent applied to the problem of minimizing the quadratic function $\frac12 (x-x^*)^\top \nabla^2f(x^*)(x-x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the minimizer of $f$, and hence depends on the properties of $f$ at the optimum only. Our numerical experiments show that SSCN outperforms non-accelerated first-order CD algorithms while being competitive to their accelerated variants.

> <p>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) offers a promising direction for sample efficient learning, often achieving state of the art results for continuous control tasks. However many existing MBRL methods rely on combining greedy policies with exploration heuristics, and even those which utilize principled exploration bonuses construct dual objectives in an ad hoc fashion. In this paper we introduce Ready Policy One (RP1), a framework that views MBRL as an active learning problem, where we aim to improve the world model in the fewest samples possible. RP1 achieves this by utilizing a hybrid objective function, which crucially adapts during optimization, allowing the algorithm to trade off reward v.s. exploration at different stages of learning. In addition, we introduce a principled mechanism to terminate sample collection once we have a rich enough trajectory batch to improve the model. We rigorously evaluate our method on a variety of continuous control tasks, and demonstrate statistically significant gains over existing approaches.</p>

> <p>We address the problem of any-code completion - generating a missing piece of source code in a given program without any restriction on the vocabulary or structure. We introduce a new approach to any-code completion that leverages the strict syntax of programming languages to model a code snippet as a tree - structural language modeling (SLM). SLM estimates the probability of the program's abstract syntax tree (AST) by decomposing it into a product of conditional probabilities over its nodes. We present a neural model that computes these conditional probabilities by considering all AST paths leading to a target node. Unlike previous techniques that have severely restricted the kinds of expressions that can be generated in this task, our approach can generate arbitrary code in any programming language. Our model significantly outperforms both seq2seq and a variety of structured approaches in generating Java and C# code. Our code, data, and trained models are available at http://github.com/tech-srl/slm-code-generation/. An online demo is available at http://AnyCodeGen.org.</p>

> <p>Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous  state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve  human performance on multiple datasets.</p>

This new method, called Aggregation of Multiple Knockoffs (AKO), addresses the instability inherent to the random nature of knockoff-based inference. Specifically, AKO improves both the stability and power compared with the original knockoff algorithm while still maintaining guarantees for false discovery rate control. We provide a new inference procedure, prove its core properties, and demonstrate its benefits in a set of experiments on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

> <p>We investigate the combination of actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms with a uniform large-scale experience replay and propose solutions for two ensuing challenges: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) the stability of off-policy learning where agents learn from other agents behaviour. </p>  <p>To this end we analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs in V-trace, a form of importance sampling for actor-critic methods. Based on our analysis, we then argue for mixing experience sampled from replay with on-policy experience, and propose a new trust region scheme that scales effectively to data distributions where V-trace becomes unstable.</p>  <p>We provide extensive empirical validation of the proposed solutions on DMLab-30. We further show the benefits of this setup in two training regimes for Atari: (1) a single agent is trained up until 200M environment frames per game (2) a population of agents is trained up until 200M environment frames each and may share experience. While (1) is a standard regime, (2) reflects the use case of concurrently executed hyper-parameter sweeps. We demonstrate state-of-the-art data efficiency among model-free agents in both regimes.</p>

> <p>Graph-based approaches are empirically shown to be very successful for the nearest neighbor search (NNS). However, there has been very little research on their theoretical guarantees. In this work, we fill this gap and rigorously analyze the performance of graph-based NNS algorithms, specifically focusing on the low-dimensional (d &lt;&lt; log n) regime. In addition to the basic greedy algorithm on the nearest neighbor graph, we also analyze the most successful heuristics commonly used in practice: speeding up via adding shortcut edges and improving accuracy via maintaining a dynamic list of candidates. We believe that our theoretical results supported by experimental analysis are an important step towards understanding the limits and benefits of graph-based NNS algorithms.</p>

As a victim, we consider RL agents whose objective is to find a policy that maximizes average reward in undiscounted infinite-horizon problem settings. The attacker can manipulate the rewards or the transition dynamics in the learning environment at training-time and is interested in doing so in a stealthy manner. We propose an optimization framework for finding an \emph{optimal stealthy attack} for different measures of attack cost. We provide sufficient technical conditions under which the attack is feasible and provide lower/upper bounds on the attack cost. We instantiate our attacks in two settings: (i) an \emph{offline} setting where the agent is doing planning in the poisoned environment, and (ii) an \emph{online} setting where the agent is learning a policy using a regret-minimization framework with poisoned feedback. Our results show that the attacker can easily succeed in teaching any target policy to the victim under mild conditions and highlight a significant security threat to reinforcement learning agents in practice.</p>

> Structured sparsity-inducing $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm, as a generalization of the classical $\ell_1$-norm, plays an important role in jointly sparse models which select or remove simultaneously all the variables forming a group. However, its resulting problem is more difficult to solve than the conventional $\ell_1$-norm constrained problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for Euclidean projection onto $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm ball. We tackle the projection problem via semismooth Newton algorithm to solve the system of semismooth equations. Meanwhile, exploiting the structure of Jacobian matrix via LU decomposition yields an equivalent algorithm which is proved to terminate after a finite number  of iterations. Empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solver and is promising for the optimization of learning problems with $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm ball constraint.

> <p>The seasonal epidemic of influenza costs thousands of lives each year in the US. While influenza epidemics occur every year, timing and size of the epidemic vary strongly from season to season. This complicates the public health efforts to adequately respond to such epidemics. Forecasting techniques to predict the development of seasonal epidemics such as influenza, are of great help to public health decision making. Therefore, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initiated a yearly challenge to forecast influenza-like illness. Here, we propose a new framework based on Gaussian process (GP) for seasonal epidemics forecasting and demonstrate its capability on the CDC reference data on influenza like illness: our framework leads to accurate forecasts with small but reliable uncertainty estimation. We compare our framework to several state of the art benchmarks and show competitive performance. We, therefore, believe that our GP based framework for seasonal epidemics forecasting will play a key role for future influenza forecasting and, lead to further research in the area.</p>

> <p>It is well known that (stochastic) gradient descent has an implicit bias towards wide minima. In deep neural network training, this mechanism serves to screen out minima. However, the precise effect that this has on the trained network is not yet fully understood. In this paper, we characterize the wide minima in linear neural networks trained with a quadratic loss. First, we show that linear ResNets with zero initialization necessarily converge to the widest of all minima. We then prove that these minima correspond to nearly balanced networks whereby the gain from the input to any intermediate representation does not change drastically from one layer to the next. Finally, we show that consecutive layers in wide minima solutions are coupled. That is, one of the left singular vectors of each weight matrix, equals one of the right singular vectors of the next matrix. This forms a distinct path from input to output, that, as we show, is dedicated to the signal that experiences the largest gain end-to-end. Experiments indicate that these properties are characteristic of both linear and nonlinear models trained in practice.</p>

> <p>The Markov assumption (MA) is fundamental to the empirical validity of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Forward-Backward Learning procedure to test MA in sequential decision making. The proposed test does not assume any parametric form on the joint distribution of the observed data and plays an important role for identifying the optimal policy in high-order Markov decision processes and partially observable MDPs. We apply our test to both synthetic datasets and a real data example from mobile health studies to illustrate its usefulness.</p>

> Distribution shift is a major obstacle to the deployment of current deep learning models on real-world problems. Let $Y$ be the class label and $X$ the features. We focus on one type of distribution shift, \textit{ label shift}, where the label marginal distribution $P_Y$ changes but the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ does not. Most existing methods estimate the density ratio between the source- and target-domain label distributions by density matching. However, these methods are either computationally infeasible for large-scale data or restricted to shift correction for discrete labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Label Transformation Framework (LTF) for correcting label shift, which implicitly models the shift of $P_Y$ and the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ using neural networks. Thanks to the flexibility of deep networks, our framework can handle continuous, discrete, and even multi-dimensional labels in a unified way and is scalable to large data. Moreover, for high dimensional $X$, such as images, we find that the redundant information in $X$ severely degrades the estimation accuracy. To remedy this issue, we propose to match the distribution implied by our generative model and the target-domain distribution in a low-dimensional feature space that discards information irrelevant to $Y$. Both theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches.

> <p>Universal probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) provide a powerful framework for specifying rich and complex probabilistic models. They further attempt to automate the process of drawing inferences from these models, but doing this successfully is severely hampered by the wide range of non-standard models they can express. As a result, although one can specify complex models in a universal PPS, the provided inference engines often fall far short of what is required. In particular, we show they produce surprisingly unsatisfactory performance for models where the support may vary between executions, often doing no better than importance sampling from the prior. To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine, which remains efficient for such models, and show how it can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing approaches on two examples.</p>

> <p>Operator-Valued Kernels (OVKs) and associated vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces provide an elegant way to extend scalar kernel methods when the output space is a Hilbert space. Although primarily used in finite dimension for problems like multi-task regression, the ability of this framework to deal with infinite dimensional output spaces unlocks many more applications, such as functional regression, structured output prediction, and structured data representation. However, these sophisticated schemes crucially rely on the kernel trick in the output space, so that most of previous works have focused on the square norm loss function, completely neglecting robustness issues that may arise in such surrogate problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper develops a duality approach that allows to solve OVK machines for a wide range of loss functions. The infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers are handled through a Double Representer Theorem, and algorithms for \epsilon-insensitive losses and the Huber loss are thoroughly detailed. Robustness benefits are emphasized by a theoretical stability analysis, as well as empirical improvements on structured data applications.</p>

> <p>In this article, we propose novel structural nested models to estimate causal effects of continuous treatments based on mobile health data. To find the treatment regime which optimizes the short-term outcomes for the patients, we define the weighted lag K advantage. The optimal treatment regime is then defined to be the one which maximizes this advantage. This method imposes minimal assumptions on the data generating process. Statistical inference can also be provided for the estimated parameters. Simulation studies and an application to the Ohio type 1 diabetes dataset show that our method could provide meaningful insights for dose suggestions with mobile health data. </p>

> <p>An acknowledged weakness of neural networks is their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations to the inputs. To improve the robustness of these models, one of the most popular defense mechanisms is to alternatively maximize the loss over the constrained perturbations (or called adversaries) on the inputs using projected gradient ascent and minimize over weights. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the maximization step towards understanding the experimentally observed effectiveness of this defense mechanism. Specifically, we investigate the landscape of the adversaries for a two-layer neural network with a quadratic loss. Our main result proves that projected gradient ascent finds a local maximum of this non-concave problem in a polynomial number of iterations with high probability.  To our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a convergence analysis of the first-order adversaries. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that, in the initial phase of adversarial training, the scale of the inputs matters in the sense that a smaller input scale leads to faster convergence of adversarial training and a ``more regular'' landscape. Finally, we show that these theoretical findings are in excellent agreement with a series of experiments.</p>

> <p>Robust optimization has been widely used in nowadays data science, especially in adversarial training. However, little research has been done to quantify how robust optimization changes the optimizers and the prediction losses comparing to standard training.  In this paper, inspired by the influence function in robust statistics, we introduce the Adversarial Influence Function (AIF) as a tool to investigate the solution produced by robust optimization. The proposed AIF enjoys a closed-form and can be calculated efficiently. To illustrate the usage of AIF, we apply it to study model sensitivity -- a quantity defined to capture the change of prediction losses on the natural data after implementing robust optimization. We use AIF to analyze how model complexity and randomized smoothing affect the model sensitivity with respect to specific models.  We further derive AIF for kernel regressions, with a particular application to neural tangent kernels, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AIF. Lastly, the theories of AIF will be extended to distributional robust optimization.</p>

> <p>Empirical studies have shown that deep generative models demonstrate inductive bias. Although this bias is crucial in problems with high dimensional data, like images, generative models lack the generalization ability that occurs naturally in human perception. For example, humans can visualize a woman smiling after only seeing a smiling man. On the contrary, the standard conditional variational auto-encoder (cVAE) is unable to generate unseen attribute combinations. To this end, we extend the cVAE by introducing a multilinear latent conditioning framework. We implement two variants of our model and demonstrate their efficacy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA. Altogether, we design a novel conditioning framework that can be used with any architecture to synthesize unseen attribute combinations.</p>

> Many popular reinforcement learning problems (e.g., navigation in a maze, some Atari games, mountain car) are instances of the episodic setting under its stochastic shortest path (SSP) formulation, where an agent has to achieve a goal state while minimizing the cumulative cost. Despite the popularity of this setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been sparsely studied in general SSP problems, with most of the theoretical literature focusing on different problems (i.e., fixed-horizon and infinite-horizon) or making the restrictive loop-free SSP assumption (i.e., no state can be visited twice during an episode). In this paper, we study the general SSP problem with no assumption on its dynamics (some policies may actually never reach the goal). We introduce UC-SSP, the first no-regret algorithm in this setting, and prove a regret bound scaling as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( D S \sqrt{ A D K})$ after $K$ episodes for any unknown SSP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, positive costs and SSP-diameter $D$, defined as the smallest expected hitting time from any starting state to the goal. We achieve this result by crafting a novel stopping rule, such that UC-SSP may interrupt the current policy if it is taking too long to achieve the goal and switch to alternative policies that are designed to rapidly terminate the episode.

> <p>This paper investigates generalisation in multi-agent games, where the generality of the agent can be evaluated by playing against opponents it hasn't seen during training. We propose two new games with concealed information and complex, non-transitive reward structure (think rock-paper-scissors). It turns out that most current deep reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently explore the strategy space, thus learning policies that generalise poorly to unseen opponents. We then propose a novel hierarchical agent architecture, where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic structure of the game -- the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents, while the low level implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding facilitates credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show that the proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents, while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.</p>

> <p>It has been observed that the performance of standard learning procedures differs widely across groups. Recent studies usually attribute this loss discrepancy to an information deficiency for one group (e.g., one group has less data). In this work, we point to a more subtle source of loss discrepancy---feature noise. Our main result is that even when there is no information deficiency specific to one group (e.g., both groups have infinite data), adding the same amount of feature noise to all individuals leads to loss discrepancy. For linear regression, we characterize this loss discrepancy in terms of the amount of noise and difference between moments of the two groups. We then study the time it takes for an estimator to adapt to a shift in the population that makes the groups have the same mean. We finally validate our results on three real-world datasets.</p>

> <p>Automating molecular design using deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of accelerating the discovery of new chemical compounds. A limitation of existing approaches is that they work with molecular graphs and thus ignore the location of atoms in space, which restricts them to (1) generating single organic molecules and (2) heuristic reward functions. To address this, we present a novel RL formulation for molecular design in 3D space, thereby extending the class of molecules that can be built. Our reward function is directly based on fundamental physical properties such as the energy, which we approximate via fast quantum-chemical calculations. To enable progress towards designing molecules in 3D space, we introduce MolGym, an RL environment comprising several molecular design tasks alongside with baselines. In our experiments, we show that our agent can efficiently learn to solve these tasks from scratch by working in a translation and rotation invariant state-action space.</p>

> <p>Recent work suggests that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) benefit disproportionately from large mini-batch sizes. This finding is interesting but also discouraging -- large batch sizes are slow and expensive to emulate on conventional hardware. Thus, it would be nice if there were some trick by which we could generate batches that were effectively big though small in practice. In this work, we propose such a trick, inspired by the use of Coreset-selection in active learning. When training a GAN, we draw a large batch of samples from the prior and then compress that batch using Coreset-selection. To create effectively large batches of real images, we create a cached dataset of Inception activations of each training image, randomly project them down to a smaller dimension, and then use Coreset-selection on those projected embeddings at training time. We conduct experiments showing that this technique substantially reduces training time and memory usage for modern GAN variants, that it reduces the fraction of dropped modes in a synthetic dataset, and that it helps us use GANs to reach a new state of the art in anomaly detection.</p>

> <p>We propose two novel conditional gradient-based methods for solving structured stochastic convex optimization problems with a large number of linear constraints. Instances of this template naturally arise from SDP-relaxations of combinatorial problems, which involve a number of constraints that is polynomial in the problem dimension. The most important feature of our framework is that only a subset of the constraints is processed at each iteration, thus gaining a computational advantage over prior works that require full passes. Our algorithms rely on variance reduction and smoothing used in conjunction with conditional gradient steps, and are accompanied by rigorous convergence guarantees. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided for illustrating the practical performance of the methods.</p>

> <p>The representation of the approximate posterior is a critical aspect of effective variational autoencoders (VAEs). Poor choices for the approximate posterior have a detrimental impact on the generative performance of VAEs due to the mismatch with the true posterior. We extend the class of posterior models that may be learned by using undirected graphical models. We develop an efficient method to train undirected approximate posteriors by showing that the gradient of the training objective with respect to the parameters of the undirected posterior can be computed by backpropagation through Markov chain Monte Carlo updates. We apply these gradient estimators for training discrete VAEs with Boltzmann machines as approximate posteriors and demonstrate that undirected models outperform previous results obtained using directed graphical models.</p>

> <p>The evolution of a deep neural network trained by the gradient descent can be described by its neural tangent kernel (NTK) as introduced in \cite{jacot2018neural}, where it was proven that in the infinite width limit the NTK converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. The NTK was also implicit in some other recent papers \cite{du2018gradient1,du2018gradient2,arora2019fine}. In the overparametrization regime, a fully-trained deep neural network is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using the limiting NTK. And the gradient descent achieves zero training loss for a deep overparameterized neural network. However, it was observed in \cite{arora2019exact} that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression using the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. This performance gap  is likely to  originate   from the change of the NTK along training due to the finite width effect. The change of the NTK along the  training is central to describe the generalization features of deep neural networks. </p>  <p>In the current paper, we study the dynamic of the NTK for finite width deep fully-connected neural networks. We derive an  infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) which captures the gradient descent  dynamic of the deep neural network. Moreover, under certain conditions  on the neural network width and the data set dimension,  we prove  that the truncated hierarchy of NTH approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to arbitrary precision. This description makes it possible to directly study the change of the NTK for deep neural networks, and sheds light on the observation that deep neural networks outperform kernel regressions using the corresponding limiting NTK. </p>

> <p>Bias in machine learning has manifested injustice in several areas, such as medicine, hiring, and criminal justice. In response, computer scientists have developed myriad definitions of fairness to correct this bias in fielded algorithms. While some definitions are based on established legal and ethical norms, others are largely mathematical. It is unclear whether the general public agrees with these fairness definitions, and perhaps more importantly, whether they understand these definitions.  We take initial steps toward bridging this gap between ML researchers and the public, by addressing the question: does a lay audience understand a basic definition of ML fairness? We develop a metric to measure comprehension of three such definitions--demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. We evaluate this metric using an online survey, and investigate the relationship between comprehension and sentiment, demographics, and the definition itself.</p>

> <p>We consider the problem of learning high-level controls over the global structure of sequence generation, particularly in the context of symbolic music generation with complex language models. In this work, we present the Transformer autoencoder, which aggregates encodings of the input data across time to obtain a global representation of style from a given performance. We show it is possible to combine this global representation with other temporally distributed embeddings, enabling improved control over the separate aspects of performance style and melody. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of music generation tasks on the MAESTRO dataset and an internal dataset with 10,000+ hours of piano performances, where we achieve improvements in terms of log-likelihood and mean listening scores as compared to relevant baselines.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we study the problem of constrained min-max optimization in a black-box setting, where the desired optimizer cannot access the gradients of the objective function but may query its values. We present a principled optimization framework, integrating a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator with an alternating projected stochastic gradient descent-ascent method, where the former only requires a small number of function queries and the later needs just one-step descent/ascent update. We show that the proposed framework, referred to as ZO-Min-Max, has a sub-linear convergence rate under mild conditions and scales gracefully with problem size. We also explore a promising connection between black-box min-max optimization and black-box evasion and poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning (ML). Our empirical evaluations on these use cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its scalability to dimensions that prohibit using recent black-box solvers.</p>

> <p>Delusional bias is a fundamental source of error in approximate Q-learning. To date, the only techniques that explicitly address delusion require comprehensive search using tabular value estimates. In this paper, we develop efficient methods to mitigate delusional bias by training Q-approximators with labels that are "consistent" with the underlying greedy policy class. We introduce a simple penalization scheme that encourages Q-labels used across training batches to remain (jointly) consistent with the expressible policy class. We also propose a search framework that allows multiple Q-approximators to be generated and tracked, thus mitigating the effect of premature (implicit) policy commitments. Experimental results demonstrate that these methods can improve the performance of Q-learning in a variety of Atari games, sometimes dramatically.</p>

  Zheng Wang, Xinqi Chu, Shandian Zhe [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1382-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1382-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>Tensor factorization is a fundamental framework to analyze high-order interactions in data. Despite the success of the existing methods, the valuable temporal information are severely underused. The timestamps of the interactions are either ignored or discretized into crude steps. The recent work although formulates event-tensors to keep the timestamps in factorization and can capture mutual excitation effects among the interaction events, it overlooks another important type of temporal influence, inhibition. In addition, it uses a local window to exclude all the long-term dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-modulating nonparametric Bayesian factorization model. We use the latent factors to construct mutually governed, general random point processes, which can capture various short-term/long-term, excitation/inhibition effects, so as to encode the complex temporal dependencies into factor representations.  In addition, our model couples with a latent Gaussian process to estimate and fuse nonlinear yet static relationships between the entities. For efficient inference, we derive a fully decomposed model evidence lower bound to dispense with the huge kernel matrix and costly summations inside the rate and log rate functions. We then develop an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm. We show the advantage of our method in four real-world applications. </p>

> <p>Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) is the problem of finding the relevant labels for an input, from a very large universe of possible labels. We consider XMC in the setting where labels are available only for groups of samples - but not for individual ones. Current XMC approaches are not built for such multi-instance multi-label (MIML) training data, and MIML approaches do not scale to XMC sizes. We develop a new and scalable algorithm to impute individual-sample labels from the group labels; this can be paired with any existing XMC method to solve the aggregated label problem. We characterize the statistical properties of our algorithm under mild assumptions, and provide a new end-to-end framework for MIML as an extension. Experiments on both aggregated label XMC and MIML tasks show the advantages over existing approaches.</p>

> <p>Missing data has the potential to affect analyses conducted in all fields of scientific study, including healthcare, economics, and the social sciences. Several approaches to unbiased inference in the presence of non-ignorable missingness rely on the specification of the target distribution and its missingness process as a probability distribution that factorizes with respect to a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we address the longstanding question of the characterization of models that are identifiable within this class of missing data distributions. We provide the first completeness result in this field of study -- necessary and sufficient graphical conditions under which, the full data distribution can be recovered from the observed data distribution. We then simultaneously address issues that may arise due to the presence of both missing data and unmeasured confounding, by extending these graphical conditions and proofs of completeness, to settings where some variables are not just missing, but completely unobserved.</p>

> <p>Heretofore, neural networks with external memory are restricted to single memory with lossy representations of memory interactions. A rich representation of relationships between memory pieces urges a high-order and segregated relational memory. In this paper, we propose to separate the storage of individual experiences (item memory) and their occurring relationships (relational memory). The idea is implemented through a novel Self-attentive Associative Memory (SAM) operator. Found upon outer product, SAM forms a set of associative memories that represent the hypothetical high-order relationships between arbitrary pairs of memory elements, through which a relational memory is constructed from an item memory. The two memories are wired into a single sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning. We achieve competitive results with our proposed two-memory model in a diversity of machine learning tasks, from challenging synthetic problems to practical testbeds such as geometry, graph, reinforcement learning, and question answering. </p>

> <p>This paper presents the Imputer, a neural sequence model that generates output sequences iteratively via imputations. The Imputer is an iterative generation model, requiring only a constant number of generation steps independent of the number of input or output tokens. The Imputer can be trained to approximately marginalize over all possible alignments between the input and output sequences, and all possible generation orders. We present a tractable dynamic programming training algorithm, which yields a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. When applied to end-to-end speech recognition, the Imputer outperforms prior non-autoregressive models and achieves competitive results to autoregressive models. On LibriSpeech test-other, the Imputer achieves 11.1 WER, outperforming CTC at 13.0 WER and seq2seq at 12.5 WER.</p>

> <p>Existing domain adaptation focuses on transferring knowledge between domains with categorical indices (e.g., between datasets A and B). However, many tasks involve continuously indexed domains. For example, in medical applications, one often needs to transfer disease analysis and prediction across patients of different ages, where age acts as a continuous domain index. Such tasks are challenging for prior domain adaptation methods since they ignore the underlying relation among domains.</p>  <p>In this paper, we propose the first method for continuously indexed domain adaptation. Our approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with a novel discriminator that models the encoding-conditioned domain index distribution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging the domain index to generate invariant features across a continuous range of domains. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaption methods on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets.</p>

> <p>Machine learning research has advanced in multiple aspects, including model structures and learning methods. The effort to automate such research, known as AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on sophisticated expert-designed layers as building blocks---or similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available. We believe these preliminary successes in discovering machine learning algorithms from scratch indicate a promising new direction for the field.</p>

> <p>Capturing the occurrence dynamics is crucial to predicting which type of events will happen next and when. A common method to do this is Hawkes processes. To enhance their capacity, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been incorporated due to RNNsâ successes in processing sequential data such as languages. Recent evidence suggests self-attention is more competent than RNNs in dealing with languages. However, we are unaware of the effectiveness of selfattention in the context of Hawkes processes. This study attempts to fill the gap by designing a self-attentive Hawkes process (SAHP). The SAHP employed self-attention to summarize influence from history events and compute the probability of the next event. One deficit of the conventional self-attention is that position embeddings only considered order numbers in a sequence, which ignored time intervals between temporal events. To overcome this deficit, we modified the conventional method by translating time intervals into phase shifts of sinusoidal functions. Experiments on goodness-of-fit and prediction tasks showed the improved capability of SAHP. Furthermore, the SAHP is more interpretable than RNN-based counterparts because the learnt attention weights revealed contributions of one event type to the happening of another type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the effectiveness of self-attention in Hawkes processes</p>

> <p>Tuning hyperparameters for unsupervised learning problems is difficult in general due to the lack of ground truth for validation. However, the success of most clustering methods depends heavily on the correct choice of the involved hyperparameters. Take for example the Lagrange multipliers of penalty terms in semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of community detection in networks, or the bandwidth parameter needed in the Gaussian kernel used to construct similarity matrices for spectral clustering. Despite the popularity of these clustering algorithms, there are not many provable methods for tuning these hyperparameters. In this paper, we provide a overarching framework with provable guarantees for tuning hyperparameters in the above class of problems under two different models. Our framework can be augmented with a cross validation procedure  to do model selection  as well. In a variety of simulation and real data experiments, we show that our framework outperforms other widely used tuning procedures in a broad range of parameter settings.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we study distributed algorithms for large-scale AUC maximization with a deep neural network as a predictive model. <br /> Although distributed learning techniques have been investigated extensively  in deep learning, they are not directly applicable to stochastic AUC maximization with deep neural networks due to its striking differences from standard loss minimization problems (e.g., cross-entropy).  Towards addressing this challenge,  we propose and analyze a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm  based on a {\it non-convex concave} reformulation of the AUC maximization, in which the communication of both the primal variable and the dual variable between each worker and the parameter server only occurs after multiple steps of gradient-based updates in each worker.  Compared with the naive parallel version of an existing algorithm that computes stochastic gradients at individual machines and averages them for updating the model parameter, our algorithm requires a much less number of communication rounds and still achieves linear speedup in theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} work that solves the {\it non-convex concave min-max} problem for  AUC maximization with deep neural networks in a communication-efficient distributed manner while still maintaining the linear speedup property in theory.   Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our algorithm and also confirm our theory. </p>

> <p>We present a new active learning algorithm that adaptively partitions the input space into a finite number of regions, and subsequently seeks a distinct predictor for each region, while actively requesting labels. We prove theoretical guarantees for both the generalization error and the label complexity of our algorithm, and analyze the number of regions defined by the algorithm under some mild assumptions. We also report the results of an extensive suite of experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrating substantial empirical benefits over existing single-region and non-adaptive region-based active learning baselines.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of Robust Outlier Arm Identification (ROAI), where the goal is to identify arms whose expected rewards deviate substantially from the majority, by adaptively sampling from their reward distributions. We compute the outlier threshold using the median and median absolute deviation of the expected rewards. This is a robust choice for the threshold compared to using the mean and standard deviation, since it can correctly identify all outlier arms even in the presence of extreme outlier values. Our setting is different from existing pure exploration problems where the threshold is pre-specified as a given value or rank. This is useful in applications where the goal is to identify the set of promising items but the cardinality of this set is unknown, such as finding promising drugs for a new disease or identifying items favored by a population. We propose two computationally efficient delta-PAC algorithms for ROAI, which includes the first UCB-style algorithm for outlier detection, and derive upper bounds on their sample complexity. We also prove a matching, up to logarithmic factors, worst case lower bound for the problem, indicating that our upper bounds are generally unimprovable. Experimental results show that our algorithms are both robust and at least 5x sample efficient compared to state-of-the-art.</p>

  Qi Cai, Zhuoran Yang, Chi Jin, Zhaoran Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1438-Metadata.json)
> While policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) achieves tremendous successes in practice, it is significantly less understood in theory, especially compared with value-based RL. In particular, it remains elusive how to design a provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that incorporates exploration. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes an Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an &quot;optimistic version&quot; of the policy gradient direction. This paper proves that, in the problem of episodic Markov decision process with linear function approximation, unknown transition, and adversarial reward with full-information feedback, OPPO achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^3 T})$ regret. Here $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, OPPO is the first provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that explores.

> <p>We aim to develop off-policy DRL algorithms that not only exceed state-of-the-art performance but are also simple and minimalistic. For standard continuous control benchmarks, Soft Actor Critic (SAC), which employs entropy maximization, currently provides state-of-the-art performance. We first demonstrate that the entropy term in SAC addresses action saturation due to the bounded nature of the action spaces. With this insight, we propose a streamlined algorithm with a simple normalization scheme or with inverted gradients. We show that both approaches can match SAC's sample efficiency performance without the need of entropy maximization. We then propose a simple non-uniform sampling method for selecting transitions from the replay buffer during training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed sampling scheme leads to state of the art sample efficiency on challenging continuous control tasks. We combine all of our findings into one simple algorithm, which we call Streamlined Off Policy with Emphasizing Recent Experience, for which we provide robust public-domain code. </p>

> <p>We propose new multi-input shape constraints across four intuitive categories:  complements, diminishers, dominance, and unimodality constraints. We show these shape constraints can be checked and even enforced when training machine-learned models for linear models, generalized additive models, and the nonlinear function class of multi-layer lattice models. Toy examples and real-world experiments illustrate how the different shape constraints can be used to increase interpretability and better regularize machine-learned models. </p>

> <p>The deterministic CUR matrix decomposition is a low-rank approximation method to analyze a data matrix. It has attracted considerable attention due to its high interpretability, which results from the fact that the decomposed matrices consist of subsets of the original columns and rows of the data matrix. The subset is obtained by optimizing an objective function with sparsity-inducing norms via coordinate descent. However, the existing algorithms for optimization incur high computation costs. This is because coordinate descent iteratively updates all the parameters in the objective until convergence. This paper proposes a fast deterministic CUR matrix decomposition. Our algorithm safely skips unnecessary updates by efficiently evaluating the optimality conditions for the parameters to be zeros. In addition, we preferentially update the parameters that must be nonzeros. Theoretically, our approach guarantees the same result as the original approach. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm speeds up the deterministic CUR while achieving the same accuracy.</p>

  Minsoo Kang, Bohyung Han [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1485-Metadata.json)
> <p>We propose a simple but effective data-driven channel pruning algorithm, which compresses deep neural networks effectively by exploiting the characteristics of operations in a differentiable way. The proposed approach makes a joint consideration of batch normalization (BN) and rectified linear unit (ReLU) for channel pruning; it estimates how likely each feature map is to be deactivated by the two successive operations and prunes the channels that have high probabilities. To this end, we learn differentiable masks for individual channels and make soft decisions throughout the optimization procedure, which allows to explore larger search space and train more stable networks. The proposed formulation combined with the training framework enables us to identify compressed models even without a separate procedure of fine-tuning. We perform extensive experiments and achieve outstanding performance in terms of the accuracy of output networks given the same amount of resources when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> <p>Robust loss functions are essential for training accurate deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of noisy (incorrect) labels. It has been shown that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that: \emph{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a problem of {\em underfitting}. To address this, we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called \emph{Active Passive Loss} (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the family of new loss functions created by our APL framework can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, especially under large noise rates such as 60\% or 80\% incorrect labels.</p>

> <p>We propose a class of kernel-based two-sample tests, which aim to determine whether two sets of samples are drawn from the same distribution. Our tests are constructed from kernels parameterized by deep neural nets, trained to maximize test power. These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and shape over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex data. By contrast, the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are spatially homogeneous, and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this scheme includes popular classifier-based two-sample tests as a special case, but improves on them in general. We provide the first proof of consistency for the proposed adaptation method, which applies both to kernels on deep features and to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple kernel learning. In experiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep kernels in hypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data.</p>

> <p>As machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed for high-impact automated decision making, ethical and increasingly also legal standards demand that they treat all individuals fairly, without discrimination based on their age, gender, race or other sensitive traits. In recent years much progress has been made on ensuring fairness and reducing bias in standard machine learning settings. Yet, for network embedding, with applications in vulnerable domains ranging from social network analysis to recommender systems, current options remain limited both in number and performance. We thus propose DeBayes: a conceptually elegant Bayesian method that is capable of learning debiased embeddings by using a biased prior. Our experiments show that these representations can then be used to perform link prediction that is significantly more fair in terms of popular metrics such as demographic parity and equalized opportunity.</p>

> <p>Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) attempts to learn a model that minimizes the local worst-case risk in the vicinity of the empirical data distribution defined by Wasserstein ball. While WDRO has received attention as a promising tool for inference since its introduction, its theoretical understanding has not been fully matured. Gao et al. (2017) proposed a minimizer based on a tractable approximation of the local worst-case risk, but without showing risk consistency. In this paper, we propose a minimizer based on a novel approximation theorem and provide the corresponding risk consistency results. Furthermore, we develop WDRO inference for locally perturbed data that include the Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) as a special case. We show that our approximation and risk consistency results naturally extend to the cases when data are locally perturbed. Numerical experiments demonstrate robustness of the proposed method using image classification datasets. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy than baseline models on noisy datasets.</p>

> <p>Extensive-form games (EFGs) are a common model of multi-agent interactions with imperfect information. State-of-the-art algorithms for solving these games typically perform full walks of the game tree that can prove prohibitively slow in large games. Alternatively, sampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization walk one or more trajectories through the tree, touching only a fraction of the nodes on each iteration, at the expense of requiring more iterations to converge due to the variance of sampled values. In this paper, we extend recent work that uses baseline estimates to reduce this variance. We introduce a framework of baseline-corrected values in EFGs that generalizes the previous work. Within our framework, we propose new baseline functions that result in significantly reduced variance compared to existing techniques. We show that one particular choice of such a function --- predictive baseline --- is provably optimal under certain sampling schemes. This allows for efficient computation of zero-variance value estimates even along sampled trajectories.</p>

> <p>Efficiently computing equilibria for multiplayer games is still an open challenge in computational game theory. This paper focuses on computing Team-Maxmin Equilibria (TMEs), which is an important solution concept for zero-sum multiplayer games where players in a team having the same utility function play against an adversary independently. Existing algorithms are inefficient to compute TMEs in large games, especially when the strategy space is too large to be represented due to limited memory. In two-player games, the Incremental Strategy Generation (ISG) algorithm is an efficient approach to avoid enumerating all pure strategies. However, the study of ISG for computing TMEs is completely unexplored. To fill this gap, we first study the properties of ISG for multiplayer games, showing that ISG converges to a Nash equilibrium (NE) but may not converge to a TME. Second, we design an ISG variant for TMEs (ISGT) by exploiting that a TME is an NE maximizing the teamâs utility and show that ISGT converges to a TME and the impossibility of relaxing conditions in ISGT. Third, to further improve the scalability, we design an ISGT variant (CISGT) by using the strategy space for computing an equilibrium that is close to TME but is easier to be computed as the initial strategy space of ISGT. Finally, extensive experimental results show that CISGT is orders of magnitude faster than ISGT and the state-of-the-art algorithm to compute TMEs in large games.</p>

> <p>The optimization of multilayer neural networks typically leads to a solution with zero training error, yet the landscape can exhibit spurious local minima and the minima can be disconnected. In this paper, we shed light on this phenomenon: we show that the combination of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and over-parameterization makes the landscape of multilayer neural networks approximately connected and thus more favorable to optimization. More specifically, we prove that SGD solutions are connected via a piecewise linear path, and the increase in loss along this path vanishes as the number of neurons grows large. This result is a consequence of the fact that the parameters found by SGD are increasingly dropout stable as the network becomes wider. We show that, if we remove part of the neurons (and suitably rescale the remaining ones), the change in loss is independent of the total number of neurons, and it depends only on how many neurons are left. Our results exhibit a mild dependence on the input dimension: they are dimension-free for two-layer networks and require the number of neurons to scale linearly with the dimension for multilayer networks. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments for different architectures and classification tasks.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks can generate images that are astonishingly realistic, so much so that it is often hard for untrained humans to distinguish them from actual photos. These achievements have been largely made possible by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While these deep fake images have been thoroughly investigated in the image domain - a classical approach from the area of image forensics - an analysis in the frequency domain has been missing. This paper addresses this shortcoming and our results reveal, that in frequency space, GAN-generated images exhibit severe artifacts that can be easily identified. We perform a comprehensive analysis, showing that these artifacts are consistent across different neural network architectures, data sets, and resolutions. In a further investigation, we demonstrate that these artifacts are caused by upsampling operations found in all current GAN architectures, indicating a structural and fundamental problem in the way images are generated via GANs. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate how the frequency representation can be used to automatically identify deep fake images, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> <p>We investigate the ability of popular flow models to capture tail-properties of a target density by studying the increasing triangular maps used in these flow methods acting on a tractable source density. We show that the density quantile functions of the source and target density provide a precise characterization of the slope of transformation required to capture tails in a target density. We further show that any Lipschitz-continuous transport map acting on a source density will result in a density with similar tail properties as the source, highlighting the trade-off between the importance of choosing a complex source density and a sufficiently expressive transformation to capture desirable properties of a target density. Subsequently, we illustrate that flow models like Real-NVP, MAF, and Glow as implemented lack the ability to capture a distribution with non-Gaussian tails. We circumvent this problem by proposing tail-adaptive flows consisting of a source distribution that can be learned simultaneously with the triangular map to capture tail-properties of a target density. We perform several synthetic and real-world experiments to complement our theoretical findings. </p>

> <p>This paper introduces the deep coordination graph (DCG) for collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning. DCG strikes a flexible trade-off between representational capacity and generalization by factoring the joint value function of all agents according to a coordination graph into payoffs between pairs of agents. The value can be maximized by local message passing along the graph, which allows training of the value function end-to-end with Q-learning. Payoff functions are approximated with deep neural networks that employ parameter sharing and low-rank approximations to significantly improve sample efficiency. We show that DCG can solve predator-prey tasks that highlight the relative overgeneralization pathology, as well as challenging StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.</p>

  Eliya Nachmani, Yossi Adi, Lior Wolf [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1558-Metadata.json)
> <p>We present a new method for separating a mixed audio sequence, in which multiple voices speak simultaneously. The new method employs gated neural networks that are trained to separate the voices at multiple processing steps, while maintaining the speaker in each output channel fixed. A different model is trained for every number of possible speakers, and a the model with the largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample. Our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art, which, as we show, is not competitive for more than two speakers. </p>

> <p>Providing users with alternatives to choose from is an essential component of many online platforms, making the accurate prediction of choice vital to their success. A renewed interest in learning choice models has led to improved modeling power, but most current methods are either limited in the type of choice behavior they capture, cannot be applied to large-scale data, or both.</p>  <p>Here we propose a learning framework for predicting choice that is accurate, versatile, and theoretically grounded. Our key modeling point is that to account for how humans choose, predictive models must be expressive enough to accommodate complex choice patterns but structured enough to retain statistical efficiency. Building on recent results in economics, we derive a class of models that achieves this balance, and propose a neural implementation that allows for scalable end-to-end training. Experiments on three large choice datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.</p>

> <p>The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a classical learning task that exemplifies the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.  However, standard formulations do not take into account risk. In online decision making systems, risk is a primary concern. In this regard, the mean-variance risk measure is one of the most common objective functions. Existing algorithms for mean-variance optimization in the context of MAB problems have unrealistic assumptions on the reward distributions. We develop Thompson Sampling-style algorithms for mean-variance MAB and provide comprehensive regret analyses for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandits with fewer assumptions. Our algorithms achieve the best known regret bounds for mean-variance MABs and also attain the information-theoretic bounds in some parameter regimes. Empirical simulations show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing LCB-based algorithms for all risk tolerances.</p>

> <p>Likelihood-free (a.k.a. simulation-based) inference problems are inverse problems with expensive, or intractable, forward models. ODE inverse problems are commonly treated as likelihood-free, as their forward map has to be numerically approximated by an ODE solver. This, however, is not a fundamental constraint but just a lack of functionality in classic ODE solvers, which do not return a likelihood but a point estimate. To address this shortcoming, we employ Gaussian ODE filtering (a probabilistic numerical method for ODEs) to construct a local Gaussian approximation to the likelihood. This approximation yields tractable estimators for the gradient and Hessian of the (log-)likelihood. Insertion of these estimators into existing gradient-based optimization and sampling methods engenders new solvers for ODE inverse problems. We demonstrate that these methods outperform standard likelihood-free approaches on three benchmark-systems.</p>

> <p>Entropy regularization in optimal transport (OT) has been the driver of many recent interests for Wasserstein metrics and barycenters in machine learning. It allows to keep the appealing geometrical properties of the unregularized Wasserstein distance while having a significantly lower complexity thanks to Sinkhorn's algorithm. However, entropy brings some inherent smoothing bias, resulting for example in blurred barycenters. This side effect has prompted an increasing temptation in the community to settle for a slower algorithm such as log-domain stabilized Sinkhorn which breaks the parallel structure that can be leveraged on GPUs, or even go back to unregularized OT. Here we show how this bias is tightly linked to the reference measure that defines the entropy regularizer and propose debiased Sinkhorn barycenters that preserve the best of worlds: fast Sinkhorn-like iterations without entropy smoothing. Theoretically, we prove that this debiasing is perfect for Gaussian distributions with equal variance. Empirically, we illustrate the reduced blurring and the computational advantage.</p>

> Deep neural networks can achieve remarkable generalization performances while interpolating the training data. Rather than the U-curve emblematic of the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a ``double descent&quot;---a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work, we develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy learning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a high-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise asymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error, and show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation threshold, beyond it which it remains constant. We disentangle the variances stemming from the sampling of the dataset, from the additive noise corrupting the labels, and from the initialization of the weights. We demonstrate that the latter two contributions are the crux of the double descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation threshold and to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We quantify how they are suppressed by ensembling the outputs of $K$ independently initialized estimators. For $K\rightarrow \infty$, the test error is monotonously decreasing and remains constant beyond the interpolation threshold. We further compare the effects of overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing. Finally, we present numerical experiments on classic deep learning setups to show that our results hold qualitatively in realistic lazy learning scenarios.

> <p>Acquiring abilities in the absence of a task-oriented reward function is at the frontier of reinforcement learning research. This problem has been studied through the lens of \textit{empowerment}, which draws a connection between option discovery and information theory. Information-theoretic skill discovery methods have garnered much interest from the community, but little research has been conducted in understanding their limitations.  Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that existing algorithms suffer from a common limitation -- they discover options that provide a poor coverage of the state space. In light of this, we propose \textit{Explore, Discover and Learn} (EDL), an alternative approach to information-theoretic skill discovery. Crucially, EDL optimizes the same information-theoretic objective derived from the empowerment literature, but addresses the optimization problem using different machinery. We perform an extensive evaluation of skill discovery methods on controlled environments and show that EDL offers significant advantages, such as overcoming the coverage problem, reducing the dependence of learned skills on the initial state, and allowing the user to define a prior over which behaviors should be learned.</p>

> <p>Computational equilibrium finding in large zero-sum extensive-form imperfect-information games has led to significant recent AI breakthroughs. The fastest algorithms for the problem are new forms of counterfactual regret minimization (Brown &amp; Sandholm, 2019). In this paper we present a totally different approach to the problem, which is competitive and often orders of magnitude better than the prior state of the art. The equilibrium-finding problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) (Koller et al., 1994), but solving it as an LP has not been scalable due to the memory requirements of LP solvers, which can often be quadratically worse than CFR-based algorithms. We give an efficient practical algorithm that factors a large payoff matrix into a product of two matrices that are typically dramatically sparser. This allows us to express the equilibrium-finding problem as a linear program with size only a logarithmic factor worse than CFR, and thus allows linear program solvers to run on such games. With experiments on poker endgames, we demonstrate in practice, for the first time, that modern linear program solvers are competitive against even game-specific modern variants of CFR in solving large extensive-form games, and can be used to compute exact solutions unlike iterative algorithms like CFR.</p>

> <p>Data-driven modeling increasingly requires to find a Nash equilibrium in multi-player games, e.g. when training GANs. In this paper, we analyse a new extra-gradient method for Nash equilibrium finding, that performs gradient extrapolations and updates on a random subset of players at each iteration. This approach provably exhibits a better rate of convergence than full extra-gradient for non-smooth convex games with noisy gradient oracle. We propose an additional variance reduction mechanism to obtain speed-ups in smooth convex games. Our approach makes extrapolation amenable to massive multiplayer settings, and brings empirical speed-ups, in particular when using a heuristic cyclic sampling scheme.Â Most importantly, it allows to train faster and better GANs and mixtures of GANs.</p>

> <p>There is a growing interest in studying the languages emerging when neural agents are jointly trained to solve tasks requiring communication through a discrete channel.  We investigate here the information-theoretic complexity of such languages, focusing on the basic two-agent, one-exchange setup. We find that, under common training procedures, the emergent languages are subject to an entropy minimization pressure that has also been detected in human language, whereby the mutual information between the communicating agent's inputs and the messages is minimized, within the range afforded by the need for successful communication. This pressure is amplified as we increase communication channel discreteness. Further, we observe that stronger discrete-channel-driven entropy minimization leads to representations with increased robustness to overfitting and adversarial attacks. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the study of natural and artificial communication systems.</p>

> <p>Spectral clustering (SC) is a popular clustering technique to find strongly connected communities on a graph. SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster. However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective.  Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p>

> <p>Generative flows are promising tractable models for density modeling that define probabilistic distributions with invertible transformations. However, tractability imposes architectural constraints on generative flows. In this work, we study a previously overlooked constraint that all the intermediate representations must have the same dimensionality with the data due to invertibility, limiting the width of the network. We propose VFlow to tackle this constraint on dimensionality. VFlow augments the data with extra dimensions and defines a maximum evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective for estimating the distribution of augmented data jointly with the variational data augmentation distribution. Under mild assumptions, we show that the maximum ELBO solution of VFlow is always better than the original maximum likelihood solution. For image density modeling on the CIFAR-10 dataset, VFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension.</p>

> <p>Space-filling designs such as Low Discrepancy Sequence (LDS), Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Jittered Sampling (JS) were proposed for fully parallel hyperparameter search, and were shown to be more effective than random and grid search. We prove that LHS and JS outperform random search only by a constant factor. Consequently, we introduce a new sampling approach based on the reshaping of the search distribution, and we show both theoretically and numerically that it leads to significant gains over random search. Two methods are proposed for the reshaping: Recentering (when the distribution of the optimum is known), and Cauchy transformation (when the distribution of the optimum is unknown). The proposed methods are first validated on artificial experiments and simple real-world tests on clustering and Salmon mappings. Then we demonstrate that they drive performance improvement in a wide range of expensive artificial intelligence tasks, namely attend/infer/repeat, video next frame segmentation forecasting and progressive generative adversarial networks.</p>

> <p>Specifying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task involves choosing a suitable planning horizon, which is typically modeled by an evaluation discount factor. It is known that applying RL algorithms with a discount set lower than the evaluation discount factor can act as a regularizer, improving performance in the limited data regime. Yet the exact nature of this regularizer has not been investigated. In this work, we fill in this gap. For TD learning and expected SARSA, we show an explicit equivalence between using a reduced discount factor and adding an explicit regularization term to the algorithm loss. For a fixed policy, we argue that chains with a uniform stationary distribution and a fast mixing rate are amenable to regularization with a reduced discount. We validate this conclusion with extensive experiments in discrete and continuous domains, using tabular and functional representations.</p>

> <p>Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, which is attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to certain symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds.</p>

> <p>Replica exchange method (RE), also known as parallel tempering, is an important technique for accelerating the convergence of the conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. However, such a method requires the evaluation of the energy function based on the full dataset and is not scalable to big data. The na\"ive implementation of RE in mini-batch settings introduces large biases, which cannot be directly extended to the stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC), the standard sampling method for simulating from deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive replica exchange SG-MCMC (reSG-MCMC) to automatically correct the bias and study the corresponding properties. The analysis implies an acceleration-accuracy trade-off in the numerical discretization of a Markov jump process in a stochastic environment. Empirically, we test the algorithm through extensive experiments on various setups and obtain the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN in both supervised learning and semi-supervised learning tasks.</p>

> <p>We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and generalizing metric (LSiM) to compare data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. We focus on scalar time-dependent 2D data that commonly arises from motion and transport-based partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a controllable data generation setup with PDE solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze generalization benefits of an adjustable training data difficulty and demonstrate the robustness of LSiM via an evaluation on three real-world data sets.</p>

> <p>Trustworthy AI is a critical issue in machine learning where, in addition to training a model that is accurate, one must consider both fair and robust training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. However, the existing model fairness techniques mistakenly view poisoned data as an additional bias, resulting in severe performance degradation. To fix this problem, we propose FR-Train, which holistically performs fair and robust model training. We provide a mutual information-based interpretation of an existing adversarial training-based fairness-only method, and apply this idea to architect an additional discriminator that can identify poisoned data using a clean validation set and reduce its influence. In our experiments, FR-Train shows almost no decrease in fairness and accuracy in the presence of data poisoning by both mitigating the bias and defending against poisoning. We also demonstrate how to construct clean validation sets using crowdsourcing, and release new benchmark datasets.</p>

> <p>In display advertising, a small group of sellers and bidders face each other in up to 10^{12} auctions a day. In this context, revenue maximisation via monopoly price learning is a high-value problem for sellers. By nature, these auctions are online and produce a very high frequency stream of data. This results in a computational strain that requires algorithms be real-time. Unfortunately, existing methods, inherited from the batch setting, suffer O(\sqrt(t)) time/memory complexity at each update, prohibiting their use. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm for online learning of monopoly prices in online auctions whose update is constant in time and memory.</p>

> <p>We present Graph Random Neural Features (GRNF), a novel embedding method from graph-structured data to real vectors based on a family of graph neural networks.  The embedding naturally deals with graph isomorphism and preserves the metric structure of the graph domain, in probability.  In addition to being an explicit embedding method, it also allows us to efficiently and effectively approximate graph metric distances (as well as complete kernel functions); a criterion to select the embedding dimension trading off the approximation accuracy with the computational cost is also provided.  GRNF can be used within traditional processing methods or as a training-free input layer of a graph neural network.  The theoretical guarantees that accompany GRNF ensure that the considered graph distance is metric, hence allowing to distinguish any pair of non-isomorphic graphs. </p>

> <p>Bayesian optimization (BO) methods often rely on the assumption that the objective function is well-behaved, but in practice, this is seldom true for real-world objectives even if noise-free observations can be collected. Common approaches, which try to model the objective as precisely as possible, often fail to make progress by spending too many evaluations modeling irrelevant details. We address this issue by proposing surrogate models that focus on the well-behaved structure in the objective function, which is informative for search, while ignoring detrimental structure that is challenging to model from few observations. First, we demonstrate that surrogate models with appropriate noise distributions can absorb challenging structures in the objective function by treating them as irreducible uncertainty. Secondly, we show that a latent Gaussian process is an excellent surrogate for this purpose, comparing with Gaussian processes with standard noise distributions. We perform numerous experiments on a range of BO benchmarks and find that our approach improves reliability and performance when faced with challenging objective functions.</p>

> <p>We introduce a family of multilayer graph kernels and establish new links between graph convolutional neural networks and kernel methods. Our approach generalizes convolutional kernel networks to graph-structured data, by representing graphs as a sequence of feature maps, where each node carries information about local graph substructures. On the one hand, the kernel point of view offers an unsupervised, expressive, and easy-to-regularize data representation, which is useful when limited samples are available. On the other hand, our model can also be trained end-to-end on large-scale data, leading to new types of graph convolutional neural networks.  We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several graph classification benchmarks, while offering simple model interpretation.</p>

> Many modern large-scale machine learning problems benefit from decentralized and stochastic optimization. Recent works have shown that utilizing both decentralized computing and local stochastic gradient estimates can outperform state-of-the-art centralized algorithms, in applications involving highly non-convex problems, such as training deep neural networks. 	 	 In this work, we propose a decentralized stochastic algorithm to deal with certain smooth non-convex problems where there are $m$ nodes in the system, and each node has a large number of samples (denoted as $n$). Differently from the majority of the existing decentralized learning algorithms for either stochastic or finite-sum problems, our focus is given to {\it both} reducing the total communication rounds among the nodes, while accessing the minimum number of local data samples. In particular, we propose an algorithm named D-GET (decentralized gradient estimation and tracking), which jointly performs decentralized gradient estimation (which estimates the local gradient using a subset of local samples) {\it and} gradient tracking (which tracks the global full gradient using local estimates). We show that, to achieve certain $\epsilon$  stationary solution of the deterministic finite sum problem, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}(mn^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication complexity. These bounds significantly improve upon the best existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(mn\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, respectively. Similarly, for online problems, the proposed method achieves an $\mathcal{O}(m \epsilon^{-3/2})$ sample complexity and  an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication complexity, while the best existing bounds are  $\mathcal{O}(m\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$.

> <p>Recent works have empirically shown that there exist adversarial examples that can be hidden from neural network interpretability (namely, making network interpretation maps visually similar), and interpretability is itself susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we theoretically show that with a proper measurement of interpretation, it is actually difficult to prevent prediction-evasion adversarial attacks from causing interpretability discrepancy, as confirmed by experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet. Spurred by that, we develop an interpretability-aware defensive scheme built only on robust interpretation (without the need of resorting to adversarial loss minimization). We show that our defense achieves both robust classification and robust interpretation, outperforming state-of-the-art adversarial training methods against   attacks of large perturbation in particular.</p>

  Liang Ding, Rui Tuo, Shahin Shahrampour [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1662-Metadata.json)
> Despite their success, kernel methods suffer from a massive computational cost in practice. In this paper, in lieu of commonly used kernel expansion with respect to $N$ inputs, we develop a novel optimal design maximizing the entropy among kernel features. This procedure results in a kernel expansion with respect to entropic optimal features (EOF), improving the data representation dramatically due to features dissimilarity. Under mild technical assumptions, our generalization bound shows that with only $O(N^{\frac{1}{4}})$ features (disregarding logarithmic factors), we can achieve the optimal statistical accuracy (i.e., $O(1/\sqrt{N})$). The salient feature of our design is its sparsity that significantly reduces the time and space cost. Our numerical experiments on benchmark datasets verify the superiority of EOF over the state-of-the-art in kernel approximation.

> <p>Although SGD with random reshuffle has been widely-used in machine learning applications, there is a limited understanding of how model characteristics affect the convergence of the algorithm. In this work, we introduce model incoherence to characterize the diversity of model characteristics and study its impact on convergence of SGD with random reshuffle \shaocong{under weak strong convexity}. Specifically, {\em minimizer incoherence} measures the discrepancy between the global minimizers of a sample loss and those of the total loss and affects the convergence error of SGD with random reshuffle.  In particular, we show that the variable sequence generated by SGD with random reshuffle converges to a certain global minimizer of the total loss under full minimizer coherence. The other {\em curvature incoherence} measures the quality of condition numbers of the sample losses and determines the convergence rate of SGD.  With model incoherence, our results show that SGD has a faster convergence rate and smaller convergence error under random reshuffle than those under random sampling, and hence provide justifications to the superior practical performance of SGD with random reshuffle.</p>

> The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions.  However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces.  We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$).  We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows.  Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure.  Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.

> <p>In this paper, we introduce a powerful and efficient framework for the direct optimization of ranking metrics. The problem is ill-posed due to the discrete structure of the loss, and to deal with that, we introduce two important techniques: a stochastic smoothing and a novel gradient estimate based on partial integration. We also address the problem of smoothing bias and present a universal solution for a proper debiasing. To guarantee the global convergence of our method, we adopt a recently proposed Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting algorithm. Our algorithm is implemented as a part of the CatBoost gradient boosting library and outperforms the existing approaches on several learning to rank datasets. In addition to ranking metrics, our framework applies to any scale-free discreet loss function.</p>

> <p>Transformers have increasingly outperformed gated RNNs in obtaining new state-of-the-art results on supervised tasks involving text sequences.  Inspired by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a dynamic set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve text instructions, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG's Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to other architectures across all tasks. Our results imply that for environments where it is possible to factorize environment observations, WMG's Transformer-based architecture can dramatically boost sample efficiency.</p>

> <p>Robust perception relies on both bottom-up and top-down signals.  Bottom-up signals consist of what's directly observed through sensation.  Top-down signals consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and the current reportable short-term memory, such as how the phrase `peanut butter and ...' will be completed.  The optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open question, but the manner of combination must be dynamic and both context and task dependent. To effectively utilize the wealth of potential top-down information available, and to prevent the cacophony of intermixed signals in a bidirectional architecture, mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow.  We explore deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention.  Modularity of the architecture further restricts the sharing and communication of information. Together, attention and modularity direct information flow, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data.  We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image classification, video prediction and reinforcement learning that the \emph{bidirectional} information flow can improve results over strong baselines.  </p>

> For distributions $p$ and $q$ with different supports, the divergence $\div{p}{q}$ may not exist. We define a spread divergence $\sdiv{p}{q}$ on modified $p$ and $q$ and describe sufficient conditions for the existence of such a divergence. We demonstrate how to maximize the discriminatory power of a given divergence by parameterizing and learning the spread. We also give examples of using a spread divergence to train and improve implicit generative models, including linear models (Independent Components Analysis) and non-linear models (Deep Generative Networks).

> <p>We address the problem of training models with black-box and hard-to-optimize metrics by expressing the metric as a monotonic function of a small number of easy-to-optimize surrogates. We pose the training problem as an optimization over a relaxed surrogate space, which we solve by estimating local gradients for the metric and performing inexact convex projections. We analyze  gradient estimates based on finite differences and local linear interpolations, and show convergence of our approach under smoothness  assumptions with respect to the surrogates. Experimental results on classification and ranking problems verify the proposal performs on par with methods that know the mathematical formulation, and adds notable value when the form of the metric is unknown.</p>

> <p>We study the question of how to imitate tasks across domains with discrepancies such as embodiment, viewpoint, and dynamics mismatch. Many prior works require paired, aligned demonstrations and an additional RL step that requires environment interactions. However, paired, aligned demonstrations are seldom obtainable and RL procedures are expensive.  In this work, we formalize the Domain Adaptive Imitation Learning (DAIL) problem - a unified framework for imitation learning in the presence of viewpoint, embodiment, and/or dynamics mismatch. Informally, DAIL is the process of learning how to perform a task optimally, given demonstrations of the task in a distinct domain. We propose a two step approach to DAIL: alignment followed by adaptation. In the alignment step we execute a novel unsupervised MDP alignment algorithm, Generative Adversarial MDP Alignment (GAMA), to learn state and action correspondences from \emph{unpaired, unaligned} demonstrations. In the adaptation step we leverage the correspondences to zero-shot imitate tasks across domains. To describe when DAIL is feasible via alignment and adaptation, we introduce a theory of MDP alignability. We experimentally evaluate GAMA against baselines in embodiment, viewpoint, and dynamics mismatch scenarios where aligned demonstrations don't exist and show the effectiveness of our approach</p>

> <p>An open question in systems and computational neuroscience is how neural circuits accumulate evidence towards a decision. Fitting models of decision-making theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but current approaches limit the number of these models that we can fit to neural data. Here we propose a general framework for modeling neural activity during decision-making. The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on constraining the parameters of recurrent state space models, for which we introduce a scalable variational Laplace-EM inference algorithm. We applied the modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator better captured the trial-averaged responses of a set of parietal neurons than a single accumulator model. Next, we identified a variable lower boundary in the responses of a parietal neuron during a random dot motion task.</p>

> <p>Program execution speed critically depends on reducing cache misses, as cache misses are orders of magnitude slower than hits.  To reduce cache misses, we focus on the problem of cache replacement: choosing which cache line to evict upon inserting a new line.  This is challenging because it requires planning far ahead and currently there is no known practical solution.  As a result, current replacement policies typically resort to heuristics designed for specific common access patterns, which fail on more diverse and complex access patterns.  In contrast, we propose an imitation learning approach to automatically learn cache access patterns by leveraging Beladyâs, an oracle policy that computes the optimal eviction decision given the future cache accesses.  While directly applying Belady's is infeasible since the future is unknown, we train a policy conditioned only on past accesses that accurately approximates Belady's even on diverse and complex access patterns.  When evaluated on four of the most memory-intensive SPEC applications, our learned policy reduces cache miss rates by 15% over the current state of the art.  In addition, on a large-scale web search benchmark, our learned policy reduces cache miss rates by 66% over a conventional LRU policy.  We release a Gym environment to facilitate research in this area, as data is plentiful, and further advancements can have significant real-world impact.</p>

> <p>Deep Metric Learning (DML) is arguably one of the most influential lines of research for learning visual similarities with many proposed approaches every year. Although the field benefits from the rapid progress, the divergence in training protocols, architectures, and parameter choices make an unbiased comparison difficult. To provide a consistent reference point, we revisit the most widely used DML objective functions and conduct a study of the crucial parameter choices as well as the commonly neglected mini-batch sampling process. Under consistent comparison, DML objectives show much higher saturation than indicated by literature. Further based on our analysis, we uncover a correlation between the embedding space density and compression to the generalization performance of DML models. Exploiting these insights, we propose a simple, yet effective, training regularization to reliably boost the performance of ranking-based DML models on various standard benchmark datasets; code and a publicly accessible WandB-repo are available at https://github.com/Confusezius/Revisiting<em>Deep</em>Metric<em>Learning</em>PyTorch.</p>

> <p>Due to the wider availability of modern electronic health records, patient care data is often being stored in the form of time-series. Clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patientsâ prognoses by identifying âsimilarâ patients, and designing treatment guidelines that are tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities). To encourage each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes, the clustering is carried out by learning discrete representations that best describe the future outcome distribution based on novel loss functions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.</p>

> <p>Supervised learning methods excel at capturing statistical properties of language when trained over large text corpora. Yet, these models often produce inconsistent outputs in goal-oriented language setting as they are not trained to complete the underlying task. Moreover, as soon as the agents are fine-tuned to maximize task completion, they suffer from the so-called language drift phenomenon: they slowly lose syntactic and semantic properties of language as they only focus on solving the task. In this paper, we propose a generic approach to counter language drift by using iterated learning. We iterate between finetuning agents with interactive training steps, and periodically replacing them with new agents that are seeded from last iteration and trained to imitate the latest finetuned models. Iterated learning does not require external syntactic constraint nor semantic knowledge, making it a valuable task-agnostic finetuning protocol. We first explore iterated learning in the Lewis Game. We then scale-up the approach in the translation game. In both settings our results show that iterated learning drastically counters language drift as well as improves the task completion metric.</p>

> We develop two new stochastic Gauss-Newton algorithms for solving a class of stochastic non-convex compositional optimization problems frequently arising in practice. We consider both the expectation and finite-sum settings under standard assumptions. We use both standard stochastic and SARAH estimators for approximating function values and Jacobians. In the expectation case, we establish $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iteration complexity to achieve a stationary point in expectation and estimate the total number of stochastic oracle calls for both function values and its Jacobian, where $\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. In the finite sum case, we also estimate the same iteration complexity and the total oracle calls with high probability. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such global stochastic oracle complexity is established for stochastic Gauss-Newton methods. We illustrate our theoretical results via numerical examples on both synthetic and real datasets.

> <p>Given n values possessed by n agents, we study the problem of estimating the mean by truthfully eliciting agents' answers to multiple-choice questions about their values. We consider two natural candidates for estimation error: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). We design a randomized estimator which is asymptotically optimal for both measures in the worst case. In the case where prior distributions over the agents' values are known, we give an optimal, polynomial-time algorithm for MSE, and show that the task of computing an optimal estimate for MAE is #P-hard. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that knowledge of prior distributions gives a significant edge.</p>

> <p>Cooperation is often implicitly assumed when learning from other agents. Cooperation implies that the agent selecting the data, and the agent learning from the data, have the same goal, that the learner infer the intended hypothesis. Recent models in human and machine learning have demonstrated the possibility of cooperation. We seek foundational theoretical results for cooperative inference by Bayesian agents through sequential data. We develop novel approaches analyzing consistency, rate of convergence and stability of Sequential Cooperative Bayesian Inference (SCBI). Our analysis of the effectiveness, sample efficiency and robustness show that cooperation is not only possible but theoretically well-founded. We discuss implications for human-human and human-machine cooperation.</p>

> Graph matching, also known as network alignment, aims at recovering the latent vertex correspondence between two unlabeled, edge-correlated weighted graphs. To tackle this task, we propose a spectral method, GRAph Matching by Pairwise eigen-Alignments (GRAMPA), which first constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer products between all pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, and then outputs a matching by a simple rounding procedure. For a universality class of correlated Wigner models, GRAMPA achieves exact recovery of the latent matching between two graphs with edge correlation $1 - 1/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and average degree at least $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This matches the state-of-the-art guarantees for polynomial-time algorithms established for correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\&#x27;{e}nyi graphs, and significantly improves over existing spectral methods. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.

> <p>We propose Zeno++, a new robust asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) procedure, intended to  tolerate Byzantine failures of  workers. In contrast to previous work, Zeno++ removes several unrealistic restrictions on worker-server communication, now allowing for fully asynchronous updates from anonymous workers, for arbitrarily stale worker updates, and for the possibility of an unbounded number of Byzantine workers. The key idea is to estimate the descent of the loss value after the candidate gradient is applied, where large descent values indicate that the update results in optimization progress. We prove the convergence of Zeno++ for non-convex problems under Byzantine failures. Experimental results show that Zeno++ outperforms existing Byzantine-tolerant asynchronous SGD algorithms.</p>

> <p>Recent works on network pruning show that large deep neural networks are often highly redundant and one can find much smaller subnetworks with much lower computational cost without a significant drop of accuracy. Most existing methods of network pruning are based on eliminating unnecessary neurons from the large networks. In this work, we study a greedy forward selection approach following the opposite direction, which starts from an empty network, and gradually adds good neurons from the large network.  Theoretically, we show that the small networks pruned using our method achieve provably lower loss than small networks trained from scratch with the same size. It implies that the learned weight of large networks is important to the small pruned models. Practically, for architectures in mobile setting, we find that fine-tuning networks pruned using our method outperforms training them from scratch. Our method improves all the prior arts on learning compact networks, using architectures such as ResNet, MobilenetV2, MobileNetV3 and ProxylessNet on ImageNet. Our theory and empirical results highlight the benefits of fine-tuning networks from large models over training from scratch, which is different from the findings of Liu et al. (2019b). </p>

> <p>We consider the problem of learning in Linear Quadratic Control systems whose transition parameters are initially unknown. Recent results in this setting have demonstrated efficient learning algorithms with regret growing with the square root of the number of decision steps.  We present new efficient algorithms that achieve, perhaps surprisingly,regret that scales only (poly-)logarithmically with the number of steps, in two scenarios: when only the state transition matrix A is unknown, and when only the state-action transition matrix B is unknown and the optimal policy satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition.  On the other hand, we give a lower bound which shows that when the latter condition is violated, square root regret is unavoidable.</p>

> <p>We introduce a new framework for the exact pointwise âp robustness verification problem that exploits the layer-wise geometric structure of deep feed-forward networks with rectified linear activations (ReLU networks). The activation regions of the network partition the input space, and one can verify the âp robustness around a point by checking all the activation regions within the desired radius. The GeoCert algorithm (Jordan et al., NeurIPS 2019) treats this partition as a generic polyhedral complex to detect which region to check next. Instead, our LayerCert framework considers the nested hyperplane arrangement structure induced by the layers of the ReLU network and explores regions in a hierarchical manner. We show that, under certain conditions on the algorithm parameters, LayerCert provably reduces the number and size of the convex programs that one needs to solve compared to GeoCert. Furthermore, the LayerCert framework allows one to incorporate lower bounding routines based on convex relaxations to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LayerCert can significantly reduce both the number of convex programs solved and the wall-clock time over the state-of-the-art.</p>

> <p>Finite-horizon sequential experimental design (SED) arises naturally in many contexts, including hyperparameter tuning in machine learning among more traditional settings. Computing the optimal policy for such problems requires solving Bellman equations, which are generally intractable. Most existing work resorts to severely myopic approximations by limiting the decision horizon to only a single time-step, which can underweight exploration in favor of exploitation. We present BINOCULARS: Batch-Informed NOnmyopic Choices, Using Long-horizons for Adaptive, Rapid SED, a general framework for deriving efficient, nonmyopic approximations to the optimal experimental policy. Our key idea is simple and surprisingly effective: we first compute a one-step optimal batch of experiments, then select a single point from this batch to evaluate. We realize BINOCULARS for Bayesian optimization and Bayesian quadrature -- two notable example problems with radically different objectives -- and demonstrate that BINOCULARS significantly outperforms significantly outperforms myopic alternatives in real-world scenarios.</p>

> <p>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) formulates the meta-learning as a bilevel optimization problem where the inner level solves each subtask based on a shared prior, while the outer level searches for the optimal shared prior based on its aggregated perfor- mance over the subtasks. Despite its empirical success, MAML remains less understood theoretically, especially in terms of its global optimality due to the nonconvexity of the meta-objective (outer-level objective). To bridge such a gap between theory and practice, we characterize the optimality gap of the stationary points attained by MAML for both reinforcement learning and supervised learning, where both the inner- and outer-level problems are solved via first-order optimization methods. In particular, our characterization connects the optimality gap of such stationary points with (i) the functional geometry of the inner-level objective and (ii) the representation power of function approximators, including both linear models and neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the global optimality of MAML with the nonconvex meta-objective for the first time.</p>

> <p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) achieves significant empirical successes. However, MARL suffers from the curse of many agents. In this paper, we exploit the symmetry of agents in MARL. In the most generic form, we study a mean-field MARL problem. Such a mean-field MARL is defined on mean-field states, which are distributions that are supported on continuous space. Based on the mean embedding of the distributions, we propose MF-FQI algorithm, which solves the mean-field MARL and establishes a non-asymptotic analysis for MF-FQI algorithm. We highlight that MF-FQI algorithm enjoys a ``blessing of many agents'' property in the sense that a larger number of observed agents improves the performance of MF-FQI algorithm.</p>

> Instance- and Label-dependent label Noise (ILN) widely exists in real-world datasets but has been rarely studied. In this paper, we focus on Bounded Instance- and Label-dependent label Noise (BILN), a particular case of ILN where the label noise rates---the probabilities that the true labels of examples flip into the corrupted ones---have upper bound less than $1$. Specifically, we introduce the concept of distilled examples, i.e. examples whose labels are identical with the labels assigned for them by the Bayes optimal classifier, and prove that under certain conditions classifiers learnt on distilled examples will converge to the Bayes optimal classifier. Inspired by the idea of learning with distilled examples, we then propose a learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees for its robustness to BILN. At last, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show effectiveness of our algorithm in learning with BILN.

> <p>We propose a novel type of hybrid model for multi-class classification, which utilizes competing linear models to collaborate with an existing black-box model, promoting transparency in the decision-making process. Our proposed hybrid model, Model-Agnostic Linear Competitors (MALC), brings together the interpretable power of linear models and the good predictive performance of the state-of-the-art black-box models. We formulate the training of a MALC model as a convex optimization problem, which optimizes the predictive accuracy and transparency (defined as the percentage of data captured by the linear models) in the objective function. Experiments show that MALC offers more model flexibility for users to balance transparency and accuracy, in contrast to the currently available choice of either a pure black-box model or a pure interpretable model. The human evaluation also shows that more users are likely to choose MALC for this model flexibility when comparing with interpretable models and black-box models.</p>

> <p>We consider the problem of learning the weighted edges of a balanced mixture of two undirected graphs from epidemic cascades.

When the conditions are met, i.e., when the graphs are connected with at least three edges, we give an efficient algorithm for learning the weights of both graphs with optimal sample complexity (up to log factors).    We give complementary results and provide sample-optimal (up to log factors) algorithms for mixtures of directed graphs of out-degree at least three, and for mixture of undirected graphs of unbalanced and/or unknown priors. </code></pre>

> <p>Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously difficult, though crucial for obtaining the best accuracy. The most popular hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search on a held-out dataset. However, grid-search requires to choose a predefined grid of parameters and scales exponentially in the number of parameters. Another class of approaches casts hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, typically solved by gradient descent. The key challenge for these approaches is the estimation of the gradient w.r.t. the hyperparameters. Computing that gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation usually suffers from high memory comsumption, while implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable. In addition, implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case of Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our proposal scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods for hyperparameter optimization.</p>

> <p>We tackle the problem disentangling the latent space of an autoencoder in order to separate labelled attribute information from other characteristic information. This then allows us to change selected attributes while preserving other information. Our method, matrix subspace projection, is much simpler than previous approaches to latent space factorisation, for  example not requiring multiple discriminators or a careful weighting among loss functions. Furthermore our new model can be applied to autoencoders as a plugin, and works across diverse domains such as images or text. We demonstrate the utility of our method for attribute manipulation in autoencoders trained across varied domains, using both human evaluation and automated methods. The quality of generation of our new model (e.g. reconstruction, conditional generation) is highly competitive to a number of strong baselines. </p>

> World models are a family of predictive models that solve self-supervised problems on how the world evolves. Humans learn world models by curiously exploring their environment, in the process acquiring compact abstractions of high bandwidth sensory inputs, the ability to plan across long temporal horizons, and an understanding of the behavioral patterns of other agents. In this work, we study how to design such a curiosity-driven Active World Model Learning (AWML) system. To do so, we simulate a curious agent building world models while visually exploring a 3D physical environment rich with distillations of representative real-world stimuli. We propose an AWML system driven by $\gamma$-Progress: a scalable and effective learning progress-based curiosity signal. We show that $\gamma$-Progress is robust to &quot;white noise&quot; and naturally gives rise to an exploration policy that allocates attention in a balanced manner, with a preference towards agents displaying complex yet learnable behaviors. As a result, our $\gamma$-Progress driven controller achieves significantly higher AWML performance than baseline controllers equipped with state-of-the-art exploration strategies such as Random Network Distillation and Model Disagreement.

> <p>Uncertainty quantification is a fundamental yet unsolved problem for deep learning. The Bayesian framework provides a principled way of uncertainty estimation but is often not scalable to modern deep neural nets (DNNs) that have a large number of parameters. Non-Bayesian methods are simple to implement but often conflate different sources of uncertainties and require huge computing resources.  We propose a new method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective.  The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty. Based on this perspective, we propose a neural stochastic differential equation model (SDE-Net) which consists of (1) a drift net that controls the system to fit the predictive function; and (2) a diffusion net that captures epistemic uncertainty. We theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to SDE-Net.  Our experiments demonstrate that the SDE-Net model can outperform existing uncertainty estimation methods across a series of tasks where uncertainty plays a fundamental role.</p>

While GANs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark learning tasks, GAN minimax optimization still poses great theoretical and empirical challenges. GANs trained using first-order optimization methods commonly fail to converge to a stable solution where the players cannot improve their objective, i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the underlying game. Such issues raise the question of the existence of Nash equilibria in the GAN zero-sum game. In this work, we show through several theoretical and numerical results that indeed GAN zero-sum games may not have any Nash equilibria. To characterize an equilibrium notion applicable to GANs, we consider the equilibrium of a new zero-sum game with an objective function given by a proximal operator applied to the original objective, a solution we call the proximal equilibrium. Unlike the Nash equilibrium, the proximal equilibrium captures the sequential nature of GANs, in which the generator moves first followed by the discriminator. We prove that the optimal generative model in Wasserstein GAN problems provides a proximal equilibrium. Inspired by these results, we propose a new approach, which we call proximal training, for solving GAN problems. We discuss several numerical experiments demonstrating the existence of proximal equilibria in GAN problems.</p>

> <p>Value function learning remains a critical component of many reinforcement learning systems. Many algorithms are based on temporal difference (TD) updates, which have well-documented divergence issues, even though potentially sound alternatives exist like Gradient TD. Unsound approaches like Q-learning and TD remain popular because divergence seems rare in practice and these algorithms typically perform well. However, recent work with large neural network learning systems reveals that instability is more common than previously thought. Practitioners face a difficult dilemma: choose an easy to use and performant TD method, or a more complex algorithm that is more sound but harder to tune, less sample efficient, and underexplored with control. In this paper, we introduce a new method called TD with Regularized Corrections (TDRC), that attempts to balance ease of use, soundness, and performance. It behaves as well as TD, when TD performs well, but is sound even in cases where TD diverges. We characterize the expected update for TDRC, and show that it inherits soundness guarantees from Gradient TD, and converges to the same solution as TD. Empirically, TDRC exhibits good performance and low parameter sensitivity across several problems.</p>

> <p>Online mirror descent (OMD) and dual averaging (DA) are two fundamental algorithms for online convex optimization. They are known to have very similar (or even identical) performance guarantees in most scenarios when a \emph{fixed} learning rate is used. However, for \emph{dynamic} learning rates OMD is provably inferior to DA. It is known that, with a dynamic learning rate, OMD can suffer linear regret, even in common settings such as prediction with expert advice. This hints that the relationship between OMD and DA is not fully understood at present.</p>  <p>In this paper, we modify the OMD algorithm by a simple technique that we call stabilization. We give essentially the same abstract regret bound for stabilized OMD and DA by modifying the classical OMD convergence analysis in a careful and modular way, yielding proofs that we believe to be clean and flexible. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with stabilization and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications even under dynamic learning rates. We also shed some light on the similarities between OMD and DA and show simple conditions under which stabilized OMD and DA generate the same iterates.</p>

> <p>The way that people make choices or exhibit preferences can be strongly affected by the set of available alternatives, often called the choice set. Furthermore, there are usually heterogeneous preferences, either at an individual level within small groups or within sub-populations of large groups. Given the availability of choice data, there are now many models that capture this behavior in order to make effective predictions. However, there is little work in understanding how directly changing the choice set can be used to influence a group's preferences or decisions. Here, we use discrete choice modeling to develop an optimization framework of such interventions for several problems of group influence, including maximizing agreement or disagreement and promoting a particular choice. We show that these problems are NP-hard in general but imposing restrictions reveals a fundamental boundary: promoting an item is easier than maximizing agreement or disagreement. After, we design approximation algorithms for the hard problems and show that they work extremely well for real-world choice data.</p>

> <p>We provide the first non-asymptotic analysis for finding stationary points of nonsmooth, nonconvex functions. In particular, we study the class of Hadamard semi-differentiable functions, perhaps the largest class of nonsmooth functions for which the chain rule of calculus holds. This class contains important examples such as ReLU neural networks and others with non-differentiable activation functions. First, we show that finding an epsilon-stationary point with first-order methods is impossible in finite time. Therefore, we introduce the notion of (delta, epsilon)-stationarity, a generalization that allows for a point to be within distance delta of an epsilon-stationary point and reduces to epsilon-stationarity for smooth functions. We propose a series of randomized first-order methods and analyze their complexity of finding a (delta, epsilon)-stationary point. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound and show that our stochastic algorithm has min-max optimal dependence on delta. Empirically, our methods perform well for training ReLU neural networks.</p>

> <p>Multi-agent coordination and routing is a complex problem and has a wide range of applications in areas from vehicle fleet coordination to autonomous mapping. Whereas traditional methods are not designed for realistic environments such as sparse connectivity and unknown traffics and are often slow in runtime; in this paper, we propose a graph neural network based model that is able to perform multiagent routing in a sparsely connected graph with dynamically changing traffic conditions, outperforming existing methods.</p>  <p>Our learned communication module in the proposed model enables the agents to coordinate online and adapt to changes to their environment. We also show that our model trained with only two agents on graphs with a maximum of twenty-five nodes can easily generalize to five agents with a hundred nodes.</p>

> <p>It is well-known that many machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, in which an attacker evades a classifier by making small perturbations to inputs. This paper discusses how industrial copyright detection tools, which serve a central role on the web, are susceptible to adversarial attacks. We discuss a range of copyright detection systems, and why they are particularly vulnerable to attacks. These vulnerabilities are especially apparent for neural network based systems. As proof of concept, we describe a well-known music identification method and implement this system in the form of a neural net.  We then attack this system using simple gradient methods, and show that it is easily broken with white box attacks. By scaling these perturnations up, we are able to create transfer attacks on industrial systems, such as the AudioTag copyright detector and YouTube's Content ID system, using perturbations that are audible but significantly smaller than a random baseline. Our goal is to raise awareness of the threats posed by adversarial examples in this space and to highlight the importance of hardening copyright detection systems to attacks.</p>

> <p>Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the manifold. One possible extension is the FrÃ©chet mean, the generalization of the Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a closed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to differentiate through the FrÃ©chet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free FrÃ©chet mean solver. This fully integrates the FrÃ©chet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our FrÃ©chet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the FrÃ©chet meanâs capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the one observed in the Euclidean setting.</p>

  Andrey Kolobov, Sebastien Bubeck, Julian Zimmert [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1917-Metadata.json)
> Existing multi-armed bandit (MAB) models make two implicit assumptions: an arm generates a payoff only when it is played, and the agent observes every payoff that is generated. This paper introduces synchronization bandits, a MAB variant where all arms generate costs at all times, but the agent observes an arm&#x27;s instantaneous cost only when the arm is played. Synchronization MABs are inspired by online caching scenarios such as Web crawling, where an arm corresponds to a cached item and playing the arm means downloading its fresh copy from a server. While not refreshed, each cached item grows progressively stale with time, continuously generating stochastic costs due to degraded cache performance, but the cache doesn&#x27;t know how much until it refreshes the item and computes the difference between the itemâs fresh version and the old one. We present MirrorSync, an online learning algorithm for synchronization bandits, establish an adversarial regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ for it, and show how to make it efficient in practice.

  Feng Wei [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1929-Metadata.json)
> <p>Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem in Natural Language Processing, which is challenging and useful in both supervised and unsupervised settings where all the words in any given text need to be disambiguated without sufficient labeled data. Typically, Most WSD systems use the sentence or a small window of words around the target word as the context for disambiguation, as their computational complexity scales exponentially with the size of the context. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised neural system, Position-wise Orthogonal Knowledge-Enhanced Disambiguator (PoKED), which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for word sense disambiguation tasks. The proposed PoKED incorporates position-wise encoding into an orthogonal framework and applies a knowledge-based attentive neural model to solve the WSD problem. Our proposed unsupervised language model is trained over unlabelled corpus, and then the pre-trained language model is capable of abstracting the surrounding context of polyseme instances in labeled corpus into context embeddings. We further utilize the semantic relations in the WordNet, by extracting semantic level inter-word connections from each document-sentence pair in the WSD dataset, and allows us to control the amount of the extraction results by setting a hyperparameter. Our experimental results from standard benchmarks show that our proposed system, PoKED, can achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art knowledge-based WSD systems.</p>

> Q-learning with neural network function approximation (neural Q-learning for short) is among the most prevalent deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Despite its empirical success, the non-asymptotic convergence rate of neural Q-learning remains virtually unknown. In this paper, we present a finite-time analysis of a neural Q-learning algorithm, where the data are generated from a Markov decision process and the action-value function is approximated by a deep ReLU neural network. We prove that neural Q-learning finds the optimal policy with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate if the neural function approximator is sufficiently overparameterized, where $T$ is the number of iterations. To our best knowledge, our result is the first finite-time analysis of neural Q-learning under non-i.i.d. data assumption.

> <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are effective in generating realistic images but the training is often unstable. There are existing efforts that model the training dynamics of GANs in the parameter space but the analysis cannot directly motivate practically effective stabilizing methods. To this end, we present a conceptually novel perspective from control theory to directly model the dynamics of GANs in the frequency domain and provide simple yet effective methods to stabilize GAN's training. We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical Dirac GAN and adopt the widely-used closed-loop control (CLC) to improve its stability. We then extend CLC to stabilize the training dynamic of normal GANs, which can be implemented as an L2 regularizer on the output of the discriminator. Empirical results show that our method can effectively stabilize the training and obtain state-of-the-art performance on data generation tasks.</p>

> <p>The Optimal Transport (a.k.a. Wasserstein) distance is an increasingly popular similarity measure for rich data domains, such as images or text documents.  This raises the necessity for fast nearest neighbor search algorithms according to this distance, which poses a substantial computational bottleneck on massive datasets.</p>  <p>In this work we introduce Flowtree, a fast and accurate approximation algorithm for the Wasserstein-1 distance. We formally analyze its approximation factor and running time.  We perform extensive experimental evaluation of nearest neighbor search algorithms in the W_1 distance on real-world dataset.  Our results show that compared to previous state of the art, Flowtree achieves up to 7.4 times faster running time.</p>

> <p>Supervised learning requires the specification of a loss function to minimise. While the theory of admissible losses from both a computational and statistical perspective is well-developed, these offer a panoply of different choices. In practice, this choice is typically made in an \emph{ad hoc} manner. In hopes of making this procedure more principled, the problem of \emph{learning the loss function} for a downstream task (e.g., classification) has garnered recent interest. However, works in this area have been generally empirical in nature.</p>  <p>In this paper,  we revisit the {\sc SLIsotron} algorithm of Kakade et al. (2011) through a novel lens,  derive a generalisation based on Bregman divergences, and show how it provides a principled procedure for learning the loss. In detail,  we cast {\sc SLIsotron} as learning a loss from a family of composite square losses. By interpreting this through the lens of \emph{proper losses}, we derive a generalisation of {\sc SLIsotron} based on Bregman divergences. The resulting {\sc BregmanTron} algorithm jointly learns the loss along with the classifier.  It comes equipped with a simple guarantee of convergence for the loss it learns, and its set of possible outputs comes with a guarantee of agnostic approximability of Bayes rule. Experiments indicate that the {\sc BregmanTron} significantly outperforms the {\sc SLIsotron}, and that the loss it learns can be minimized by other algorithms for different tasks, thereby opening the interesting problem of \textit{loss transfer} between domains.</p>

  Xiyu Yu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, Kun Zhang, Kayhan Batmanghelich, Dacheng Tao [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1942-Metadata.json)
> Domain adaptation aims to correct the classifiers when faced with distribution shift between source (training) and target (test) domains. State-of-the-art domain adaptation methods make use of deep networks to extract domain-invariant representations. However, existing methods assume that all the instances in the source domain are correctly labeled; while in reality, it is unsurprising that we may obtain a source domain with noisy labels. In this paper, we first investigate how label noise could adversely affect existing domain adaptation methods in various scenarios. Focusing on the generalized target shift scenario, where both label distribution $P_Y$ and the class-conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ can change, we propose a new Denoising Conditional Invariant Component (DCIC) framework, which provably ensures (1) extracting invariant representations given examples with noisy labels in the source domain and unlabeled examples in the target domain and (2) estimating the label distribution in the target domain with no bias. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> <p>The task of text classification is usually divided into two stages: text feature extraction and classification. In this standard formalization, categories are merely represented as indexes in the label vocabulary, and the model lacks for explicit instructions on what to classify. Inspired by the current trend of formalizing NLP problems as question answering tasks, we propose a new framework for text classification, in which each category label is associated with a category description. Descriptions are generated by hand-crafted templates or using abstractive/extractive models from reinforcement learning. The concatenation of the description and the text is fed to the classifier to decide whether or not the current label should be assigned to the text. The proposed strategy forces the model to attend to the most salient texts with respect to the label, which can be regarded as a hard version of attention, leading to better performances. We observe significant performance boosts over strong baselines on a wide range of text classification tasks including single-label classification, multi-label classification and multi-aspect sentiment analysis.</p>

> We study the bandit problem where the underlying expected reward is a Bounded Mean Oscillation (BMO) function. BMO functions are allowed to be discontinuous and unbounded, and are useful in modeling signals with singularities in the domain.  For example, BMO functions can model the intensity field of several radioactive emitting sources.  A bandit BMO algorithm can help us quickly locate the strongest emitting source. We develop a toolset for BMO bandits, and provide an algorithm that can achieve poly-log $\delta$-regret -- a regret measured against an arm that is optimal after removing a $\delta$-sized portion of the arm space.

> <p>In many real tasks, we care about how to make decisions other than mere predictions on an event, e.g. how to increase the revenue next month instead of knowing it will drop. The key is to identify the causal effects on the desired event. Pearl proposed do-calculus to make it given the knowledge of causal structure (Pearl, 2009). But sometimes, we have to discover it at first. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for this challenging task where only the response variable is observable under intervention. By an active strategy introducing limited interventions and exploiting the exact distribution of the response variable, the proposed approach can cost-effectively identify the causal effect of each intervention, and thus guide the decision-making. Theoretical analysis along with empirical studies is presented to show that our approach can achieve causal effect identification with fewer interventions.</p>

> <p>A complementary label (CL) simply indicates an incorrect class of an example, but learning with CLs results in multi-class classifiers that can predict the correct class. Unfortunately, the problem setting of previous research only allows a single CL for each example, which notably limits its potential since our labelers may easily identify multiple complementary labels (MCLs) to one example. In this paper, we propose a novel problem setting to allow MCLs for each example and two ways for learning with MCLs. In the first way, we design two wrappers that decompose MCLs into many single CLs in different manners, so that we could use any method for learning with CLs. However, we find that the supervision information that MCLs hold is conceptually diluted after decomposition. Thus, in the second way, we derive an unbiased risk estimator; minimizing it processes each set of MCLs as a whole and possesses an estimation error bound. In addition, we improve the second way into minimizing properly chosen upper bounds for practical implementation. Experiments show that the former way works well for learning with MCLs while the latter is even better on various benchmark datasets.</p>

> <p>We introduce a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph level  representations by contrasting structural views of graphs. We show that unlike  visual representation learning, increasing the number of views to more than two or  contrasting multi-scale encodings do not improve performance, and the best  performance is achieved by contrasting encodings from first-order neighbors and  a graph diffusion. We achieve new state-of-the-art results in self-supervised  learning on 8 out of 8 node and graph classification benchmarks under the linear  evaluation protocol. For example, on Cora (node) and Reddit-Binary (graph)  classification benchmarks, we achieve 86.8% and 84.5% accuracy, which are  5.5% and 2.4% relative improvements over previous state-of-the-art. When  compared to supervised baselines, our approach outperforms them in 4 out of 8  benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Deep generative modeling has achieved many successes for continuous data generation, such as producing realistic images and controlling their properties (e.g., styles). However, the development of generative modeling techniques for optimizing discrete data, such as sequences or strings, still lags behind largely due to the challenges in modeling complex and long-range constraints, including both syntax and semantics, in discrete structures. For example, to generate a string representing a molecule structure or a mathematical expression with a  desired quantitative property, we need to both ensure the validity of the generated string subject to a grammar and model the string representation so that it is predictive of the property.  In this paper, we formulate the sequence optimization task as a chance-constrained sampling problem. The key idea is to enforce a high probability of generating valid sequences and also optimizes the property of interest. We propose a novel minmax algorithm based a tightening of the chance constraint, by jointly tightening a bound of the valid chance and optimizing the expected property. Extensive experimental results in three domains, including arithmetic expressions, Python programs, and SMILES strings for molecules, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing sequence optimization methods. In particular, it is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the molecule optimization task where the current best methods are graph-based.</p>

> <p>Over-parameterization is ubiquitous nowadays in training neural networks to benefit both optimization in seeking global optima and generalization in reducing prediction error. However, compressive networks are desired in many real world applications and direct training of small networks may be trapped in local optima. In this paper, instead of pruning or distilling over-parameterized models to compressive ones, we propose a new approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces. Specifically, it generates a family of models from simple to complex ones that couples a pair of parameters to simultaneously train over-parameterized deep models and structural sparsity of which on weights of fully connected (fc) and convolutional layers. Such a differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, proposed as deep Structural Splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (dS^2LBI), whose global convergence analysis in deep learning is established that from any initializations, algorithmic iterations converge to a critical point of empirical risks. Experimental evidence shows that gS^2LBI achieve comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers in exploring the structural sparsity of several widely used backbones on the benchmark datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, gS2LBI unveils âwinning ticketsâ, i.e., the effective sparse structure with comparable test accuracy to over-parameterized models after retraining.</p>

  Liang Bai, Jiye Liang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1982-Metadata.json)
> <p>Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and spectral clustering (SC) are both state-of-the-art methods to identify complex clusters in high-dimensional input space. However, there are few researches to discuss the relation between them. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an explicit theoretical connection between them from the respective of learning a data similarity matrix. We show that spectral clustering with Gaussian kernel can be viewed as sparse subspace clustering with entropy-norm (SSC+E). Compared to existing SSC algorithms, the SSC+E algorithm can obtain a sparse, analytical, symmetrical and nonnegative similarity matrix. Besides, it makes use of Gaussian kernel to compute the sparse similarity matrix of objects, which can avoid the complex computation of the sparse optimization program of SSC. Finally, we provide the experimental analysis to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of sparse subspace clustering and spectral clustering on ten benchmark data sets. The theoretical and experimental analysis can well help users for the selection of high-dimensional data clustering algorithms.</p>

> <p>Data augmentation is a powerful technique to improve performance in applications such as image and text classification tasks. Yet, there is little rigorous understanding of why and how various augmentations work. In this work, we consider a family of linear transformations and study their effects on the ridge estimator in an over-parametrized linear regression setting. First, we show that transformations which preserve the labels of the data can improve estimation by enlarging the span of the training data. Second, we show that transformations which mix data can improve estimation by playing a regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights on MNIST.</p>  <p>Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches over the space of transformations by how uncertain the model is about the transformed data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For example, our method outperforms RandAugment by 1.24% on CIFAR-100 using Wide-ResNet-28-10. Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA Adversarial Autoaugment on CIFAR datasets.</p>

> <p>Most existing feature selection methods in literature are linear models, so that the nonlinear relations between features and response variables are not considered. Meanwhile, in these feature selection models, the interactions between features are often ignored or just discussed under prior structure information. To address these challenging issues, we consider the problem of sparse additive models for high-dimensional nonparametric regression with the allowance of the flexible interactions between features. A new method, called as sparse shrunk additive models (SSAM), is proposed to explore the structure information among features. This method bridges sparse kernel regression and sparse feature selection. Theoretical results on the convergence rate and sparsity characteristics of SSAM are established by the novel analysis techniques with integral operator and concentration estimate. In particular, our algorithm and theoretical analysis only require the component functions to be continuous and bounded, which are not necessary to be in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

  Andrey Voynov, Artem Babenko [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2025-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2025-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>The latent spaces of GAN models often have semantically meaningful directions. Moving in these directions corresponds to human-interpretable image transformations, such as zooming or recoloring, enabling a more controllable generation process. However, the discovery of such directions is currently performed in a supervised manner, requiring human labels, pretrained models, or some form of self-supervision. These requirements severely restrict a range of directions existing approaches can discover. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised method to identify interpretable directions in the latent space of a pretrained GAN model. By a simple model-agnostic procedure, we find directions corresponding to sensible semantic manipulations without any form of (self-)supervision. Furthermore, we reveal several non-trivial findings, which would be difficult to obtain by existing methods, e.g., a direction corresponding to background removal. As an immediate practical benefit of our work, we show how to exploit this finding to achieve competitive performance for weakly-supervised saliency detection. The implementation of our method is available online.</p>

> <p>Modern deep neural networks require a significant amount of computing time and power to train and deploy, which limits their usage on edge devices. Inspired by the iterative weight pruning in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, we propose DropNet, an iterative pruning method which prunes nodes/filters to reduce network complexity. DropNet iteratively removes nodes/filters with the lowest average post-activation value across all training samples. Empirically, we show that DropNet is robust across a wide range of scenarios, including MLPs and CNNs using the MNIST and CIFAR datasets. We show that up to 90% of the nodes/filters can be removed without any significant loss of accuracy. The final pruned network performs well even with reinitialisation of the weights and biases. DropNet also achieves similar accuracy to an oracle which greedily removes nodes/filters one at a time to minimise training loss, highlighting its effectiveness.</p>

> <p>Self-supervised learning, which learns by constructing artificial labels given only the input signals, has recently gained considerable attention for learning representations with unlabeled datasets, i.e., learning without any human-annotated supervision. In this paper, we show that such a technique can be used to significantly improve the model accuracy even under fully-labeled datasets. Our scheme trains the model to learn both original and self-supervised tasks, but is different from conventional multi-task learning frameworks that optimize the summation of their corresponding losses. Our main idea is to learn a single unified task with respect to the joint distribution of the original and self-supervised labels, i.e., we augment original labels via self-supervision. This simple, yet effective approach allows to train models easier by relaxing a certain invariant constraint during learning the original and self-supervised tasks simultaneously. It also enables an aggregated inference which combines the predictions from different augmentations to improve the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique, which we refer to as self-distillation, that has the effect of the aggregated inference in a single (faster) inference. We demonstrate the large accuracy improvement and wide applicability of our framework on various fully-supervised settings, e.g., the few-shot and imbalanced classification scenarios.</p>

> <p>Generating formal-language programs represented by relational tuples, such as Lisp programs or mathematical operations, from natural-language problems is a challenging task because it requires explicitly capturing discrete symbolic structural information implicit in the input. However, most general neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural information, limiting their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural representation, Tensor Product Representations (TPRs), for generating formal-language solutions from natural-language, called TP-N2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR <code>binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR</code>unbinding' to generate, in symbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and creates new state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies show that improvements can be attributed to the use of structured TPRs explicitly in both the encoder and decoder. Analysis of the learned structures shows how TPRs enhance the interpretability of TP-N2F.</p>

> <p>Recurrent neural networks (RNN) as used in machine learning are commonly formulated in discrete time, i.e. as recursive maps. This brings a lot of advantages for training models on data, e.g. for the purpose of time series prediction or dynamical systems identification, as powerful and efficient inference algorithms exist for discrete time systems and numerical integration of differential equations is not necessary. On the other hand, mathematical analysis of dynamical systems inferred from data is often more convenient and enables additional insights if these are formulated in continuous time, i.e. as systems of ordinary (or partial) differential equations (ODE). Here we show how to perform such a translation from discrete to continuous time for a particular class of ReLU-based RNN. We prove three theorems on the mathematical equivalence between the discrete and continuous time formulations under a variety of conditions, and illustrate how to use our mathematical results on different machine learning and nonlinear dynamical systems examples.</p>

> <p>Representing shapes as level-sets of neural networks has been recently proved to be useful for different shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. So far, such representations were computed using either: (i) pre-computed implicit shape representations; or (ii) loss functions explicitly defined over the neural level-sets. </p>  <p>In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (i.e., point clouds, with or without normal information). We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level-set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions.  We provide a theoretical analysis of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads to state-of-the-art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details and fidelity compared to previous methods. </p>

> <p>We propose a novel framework for structured bandits, which we call influence diagram bandit. Our framework captures complicated statistical dependencies between actions, latent variables, and observations; and unifies and extends many existing models, such as combinatorial semi-bandits, cascading bandits, and low-rank bandits. We develop novel online learning algorithms that allow us to act efficiently in our models. The key idea is to track a structured posterior distribution of model parameters, either exactly or approximately. To act, we sample model parameters from their posterior and then use the structure of the influence diagram to find the most optimistic actions under the sampled parameters. We experiment with three structured bandit problems: cascading bandits, online learning to rank in the position-based model, and rank-1 bandits. Our algorithms achieve up to about 3 times higher cumulative reward than baselines.</p>

> <p>Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) inherently gather the information necessary to act optimally under uncertainties. The framework can be extended to model pure information gathering tasks by considering belief-based rewards. This allows us to use reward shaping to guide POMDP planning to informative beliefs by using a weighted combination of the original reward and the expected information gain as the objective. In this work we propose a novel online algorithm, Information Particle Filter Tree (IPFT), to solve problems with belief-dependent rewards on continuous domains. It simulates particle-based belief trajectories in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach to construct a search tree in the belief space. The evaluation shows that the consideration of information gain greatly improves the performance in problems where information gathering is an essential part of the optimal policy.</p>

> <p>Variational inference is becoming more and more popular for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Meanwhile, a few recent works have provided theoretical justification and new insights on deep neural networks for estimating smooth functions in usual settings such as nonparametric regression. In this paper, we show that variational inference for sparse deep learning retains precisely the same generalization properties than exact Bayesian inference. In particular, we show that a wise choice of the neural network architecture leads to near-minimax rates of convergence for H\"older smooth functions. Additionally, we show that the model selection framework over the architecture of the network via ELBO maximization does not overfit and adaptively achieves the optimal rate of convergence.</p>

  Zhiyu Yao, Yunbo Wang, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2121-Metadata.json)
> <p>This paper explores a new research problem of unsupervised transfer learning across multiple spatiotemporal prediction tasks. Unlike most existing transfer learning methods that focus on fixing the discrepancy between supervised tasks, we study how to transfer knowledge from a zoo of unsupervisedly learned models towards another predictive network. Our motivation is that models from different sources are expected to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from different perspectives, and thus provide an effective supplement to the new task, even if this task already has sufficient training data. Technically, we propose a differentiable framework named transferable memory. It adaptively distills knowledge from a bank of memory states of predictive networks, and then applies it to the target network with a novel recurrent structure called transferable memory unit (TMU). Compared with finetuning, our approach yields significant improvements on three benchmarks for spatiotemporal prediction, and benefits the target task even from less relevant pretext tasks.</p>

> <p>We present a novel communication-efficient Newton-type algorithm for finite-sum optimization over a distributed computing environment. Our method, named DINO, overcomes both theoretical and practical shortcomings of similar existing methods. Under minimal assumptions, we guarantee global sub-linear convergence of DINO to a first-order stationary point for general non-convex functions and arbitrary data distribution over the network. Furthermore, for functions satisfying Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, we show that DINO enjoys a linear convergence rate. Our proposed algorithm is practically parameter free, in that it will converge regardless of the selected hyper-parameters, which are easy to tune. Additionally, its sub-problems are simple linear least-squares, for which efficient solvers exist, and numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of DINO as compared with similar alternatives.</p>

> <p>We define a quantum version of Expectation-Maximization (QEM), a fundamental tool in unsupervised machine learning, often used to solve Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation problems. We use QEM to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model, and show how to generalize it to fit mixture models with base distributions in the exponential family. Given quantum access to a dataset, our algorithm has convergence and precision guarantees similar to the classical algorithm, while the runtime is polylogarithmic in the number of elements in the training set and polynomial in other parameters, such as the dimension of the feature space and the number of components in the mixture. We discuss the performance of the algorithm on datasets that are expected to be classified successfully by classical EM and provide guarantees for its runtime.</p>

> Max-margin methods for binary classification such as the support vector machine (SVM) have been extended to the structured prediction setting under the name of max-margin Markov networks ($M^3N$), or more generally structural SVMs. These methods are able to model interactions between output parts and incorporate a cost between labels. Unfortunately, these methods are inconsistent when the relationship between inputs and labels is far from deterministic. To overcome such limitations, in this paper we go beyond max-margin, defining the learning problem in terms of a ``max-min&#x27;&#x27; margin formulation. The resulting method, which we name max-min margin Markov networks ($M^4N$), provides a correction of the $M^3N$ loss that is key to achieve consistency in the general case. In this paper, we prove consistency and finite sample generalization bounds for $M^4N$ and provide an explicit algorithm to compute the estimator. The algorithm has strong statistical and computational guarantees: in a worst case scenario it achieves a generalization error of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for a total cost of $O(n\sqrt{n})$ marginalization-oracle calls, which have essentially the same cost as the max-oracle from $M^3N$. Experiments on multi-class classification and handwritten character recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over $M^3N$ networks.

  Prashanth L.A., Krishna Jagannathan, Ravi Kolla [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2156-Metadata.json)
> <p>Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a widely used risk metric in applications such as finance. We derive concentration bounds for CVaR estimates, considering separately the cases of sub-Gaussian, light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions. For the sub-Gaussian and light-tailed cases, we use a classical CVaR estimator based on the empirical distribution constructed from the samples. For heavy-tailed random variables, we assume a mild `bounded moment' condition, and derive a concentration bound for a truncation-based estimator. Our concentration bounds exhibit exponential decay in the sample size, and are tighter than those available in the literature for the above distribution classes. To demonstrate the applicability of our concentration results, we consider the CVaR optimization problem in a multi-armed bandit setting. Specifically, we address (i) the best CVaR-arm identification problem under a fixed budget; and (ii) CVaR-based regret minimization. Using our CVaR concentration bounds, we derive an upper-bound on the probability of incorrect identification for (i), and a regret guarantee for (ii).</p>

> <p>Motivated by the repeated sale of online ads via auctions, optimal pricing in repeated auctions has attracted a large body of research. While dynamic mechanisms offer powerful techniques to improve on both revenue and efficiency by optimizing auctions across different items, their reliance on exact distributional information of buyers' valuations (present and future) limits their use in practice. In this paper, we propose robust dynamic mechanism design. We develop a new framework to design dynamic mechanisms that are robust to both estimation errors in value distributions and strategic behavior. We apply the framework in learning environments, leading to the first policy that achieves provably low regret against the optimal dynamic mechanism in contextual auctions, where the dynamic benchmark has full and accurate distributional information.</p>

> Studies of acquiring appropriate continuous representations of a discrete objects such as graph and knowledge based data have been conducted by many researches in the field of machine learning. In this paper, we introduce Nested SubSpace arrangement (NSS arrangement), a comprehensive framework for representation learning. We show that existing embedding techniques can be regarded as a member of NSS arrangement. Based on the concept of the NSS arrangement, we implemented Disk-ANChor ARrangement (DANCAR), a representation learning method specializing to reproduce general graphs. Numerical experiments have shown that DANCAR has successfully embedded WordNet in ${\mathbb R}^{20}$ with the F1 score of 99.3\% in the reconstruction task. DANCAR is also suitable for visualization to understand the characteristics of graph.

> <p>We propose a framework for learning neural scene representations directly from images, without 3D supervision. Our key insight is that 3D structure can be imposed by ensuring that the learned representation transforms like a real 3D scene. Specifically, we introduce a loss which enforces equivariance of the scene representation with respect to 3D transformations. Our formulation allows us to infer and render scenes in real time while achieving comparable results to models requiring minutes for inference. In addition, we introduce two challenging new datasets for scene representation and neural rendering, including scenes with complex lighting and backgrounds. Through experiments, we show that our model achieves compelling results on these datasets as well as on standard ShapeNet benchmarks.</p>

> <p>We consider the study of a classification model whose properties are impossible to estimate using a validation set, either due to the absence of such a set or because access to the classifier, even as a black-box, is impossible. Instead, only aggregate statistics on the rate of positive predictions in each of several sub-populations are available, as well as the true rates of positive labels in each of these sub-populations.  We show that these aggregate statistics can be used to lower-bound the discrepancy of a classifier, which is a measure that balances inaccuracy and unfairness. To this end, we define a new measure of unfairness, equal to the fraction of the population on which the classifier behaves differently, compared to its global, ideally fair behavior, as defined by the measure of equalized odds.  We propose an efficient and practical procedure for finding the best possible lower bound on the discrepancy of the classifier, given the aggregate statistics, and demonstrate in experiments the empirical tightness of this lower bound, as well as its possible uses on various types of problems, ranging from estimating the quality of voting polls to measuring the effectiveness of patient identification from internet search queries.

> <p>Gaussian processes are nonparametric Bayesian models that have been applied to regression and classification problems. One of the approaches to alleviate their cubic training cost is the use of local GP experts trained on subsets of the data. While these expert models allow for massively distributed computation, their predictions can suffer from erratic behaviour of the mean or unrealistic uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we provide a solution to these problems for multiple expert models, including the generalised product of experts and the robust Bayesian committee machine. Furthermore, we leverage the optimal transport literature and propose a new expert model that averages predictions of local experts by computing their Wasserstein barycenter, which can be applied to both regression and classification settings.</p>

> <p>A fundamental challenge in contextual bandits is to develop flexible, general-purpose algorithms with computational requirements no worse than classical supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression. Algorithms based on regression have shown promising empirical success, but theoretical guarantees have remained elusive except in special cases. We provide the first universal and optimal reduction from contextual bandits to online regression. We show how to transform any oracle for online regression with a given value function class into an algorithm for contextual bandits with the induced policy class, with no overhead in runtime or memory requirements. We characterize the minimax rates for contextual bandits with general, potentially nonparametric function classes, and show that our algorithm is minimax optimal whenever the oracle obtains the optimal rate for regression. Compared to previous results, our algorithm requires no distributional assumptions beyond realizability, and works even when contexts are chosen adversarially.</p>

> <p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach for graph-structured data.  Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the {\em over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks.  We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\em Initial residual} and {\em Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks.  </p>

> To deal with complicated constraints via locally light computation in distributed online learning, recent study has presented a projection-free algorithm called distributed online conditional gradient (D-OCG), and achieved an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of prediction rounds. However, in each round, the local learners of D-OCG need to communicate with their neighbors to share the local gradients, which results in a high communication complexity of $O(T)$. In this paper, we first propose an improved variant of D-OCG, namely D-BOCG, which enjoys an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret bound with only $O(\sqrt{T})$ communication complexity. The key idea is to divide the total prediction rounds into $\sqrt{T}$ equally-sized blocks, and only update the local learners in the beginning of each block by performing iterative linear optimization steps. Furthermore, to handle the more challenging bandit setting, in which only the loss value is available, we incorporate the classical one-point gradient estimator into D-BOCG, and obtain similar theoretical guarantees.

> <p>Humans have the ability to robustly recognize objects with various factors of variations such as nonrigid transformation, background noise, and change in lighting conditions. However, deep learning frameworks generally require huge amount of data with instances under diverse variations, to train a robust model. To alleviate the need of collecting large data and better learn from scarce samples, we propose a novel meta-learning method which learns to transfer factors of variations from one class to another, such that it can improve the classification performance on unseen examples. Transferred variations generate virtual samples that augment the feature space of the target class during training, simulating upcoming query samples with similar variations. By sharing factors of variations across different classes, the model becomes more robust to variations in the unseen examples and tasks using small number of examples per class. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for few-shot classification and face recognition, on which our model significantly improves the performance of the base model, outperforming relevant baselines.</p>

> We initiate the study of coresets for clustering in graph metrics, i.e., the shortest-path metric of edge-weighted graphs. Such clustering problems are essential to data analysis and used for example in road networks and data visualization. A coreset is a compact summary of the data that approximately preserves the clustering objective for every possible center set, and it offers significant efficiency improvements in terms of running time, storage, and communication, including in streaming and distributed settings. Our main result is a near-linear time construction of a coreset for k-Median in a general graph $G$, with size $O_{\epsilon, k}(\tw(G))$ where $\tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$, and we complement the construction with a nearly-tight size lower bound. The construction is based on the framework of Feldman and Langberg [STOC 2011], and our main technical contribution, as required by this framework, is a uniform bound of $O(\tw(G))$ on the shattering dimension under any point weights. We validate our coreset on real-world road networks, and our scalable algorithm constructs tiny coresets with high accuracy, which translates to a massive speedup of existing approximation algorithms such as local search for graph k-Median.

> <p>Deep neural networks have been proven to be vulnerable to the so-called adversarial attacks. Recently there have been efforts to defend such attacks with deep generative models. These defenses often involve an inversion phase that they first seek the latent representation that best matches with the input, then use this representation for prediction. Such defenses are often difficult to attack due to the non-analytical gradients. In this work, we develop a new gradient approximation attack to break these defenses. The idea is to view the inversion phase as a dynamical system, through which we extract the gradient with respect to the input by tracing its recent trajectory. An amortized strategy is further developed to accelerate the attack. Experiments show that our attack outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (e.g Backward Pass Differential Approximation) with unprecedented low distortions. Additionally, our empirical results reveal a key defect of current deep generative model-based defenses that it may not realize the on-manifold conjecture expectedly.</p>

> <p>We propose a new family of bandit algorithms, that are formulated in a general way based on the Biased Maximum Likelihood Estimation (BMLE) method originally appearing in the adaptive control literature. We design the reward-bias term to tackle the exploration and exploitation tradeoff for stochastic bandit problems. We provide a general recipe for the BMLE algorithm and derive a simple explicit closed-form expression for the index of an arm for exponential family reward distributions. We prove that the derived BMLE indices achieve a logarithmic finite-time regret bound and hence attain order-optimality, for both exponential families and the cases beyond parametric distributions. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve regret performance comparable to the best of several state-of-the-art baseline methods, while being computationally efficient in comparison to other best-performing methods. The generality of the proposed approach makes it possible to address more complex models, including general adaptive control of Markovian systems.</p>

> We are interested in learning algorithms that optimize revenue in repeated contextual posted-price auctions where a single seller faces a single strategic buyer. In our setting, the buyer  maximizes his expected cumulative discounted surplus, and his valuation of a good is assumed to be a fixed function of a $d$-dimensional context (feature) vector. We introduce a novel deterministic learning algorithm that is based on ideas of the Bisection method and has strategic regret upper bound of $O(\log^2 T)$. Unlike previous works, our algorithm does not require any assumption on the distribution of context information, and the regret guarantee holds for any realization of feature vectors (adversarial upper bound). To construct our algorithm we non-trivially adopted techniques of integral geometry to act against buyer strategicness and improved the penalization trick to work in contextual auctions.

> <p>Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are useful models for graph classification and graph-based regression tasks. In these tasks, graph pooling is a critical ingredient by which GNNs adapt to input graphs of varying size and structure. We propose a new graph pooling operation based on compressive Haar transforms --- \emph{HaarPooling}. HaarPooling implements a cascade of pooling operations; it is computed by following a sequence of clusterings of the input graph. A HaarPooling layer transforms a given input graph to an output graph with a smaller node number and the same feature dimension; the compressive Haar transform filters out fine detail information in the Haar wavelet domain. In this way, all the HaarPooling layers together synthesize the features of any given input graph into a feature vector of uniform size. Such transforms provide a sparse characterization of the data and preserve the structure information of the input graph. GNNs implemented with standard graph convolution layers and HaarPooling layers achieve state of the art performance on diverse graph classification and regression problems.</p>

> <p>A common workflow in data exploration is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data, identify groups of points in that representation, and examine the differences between the groups to determine what they represent.  We treat this as an interpretable machine learning problem by leveraging the model that learned the low-dimensional representation to help identify the key differences between the groups.  To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of explanation, a Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE), and our algorithm, Transitive Global Translations (TGT), for computing GCEs.   TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups using compressed sensing but constrains those pairwise differences to be consistent among all of the groups.  Empirically, we demonstrate that TGT is able to identify explanations that accurately explain the model while being relatively sparse, and that these explanations match real patterns in the data. </p>

> <p>We present a framework for autonomously learning a portable representation that describes a collection of low-level continuous environments. We show that these abstract representations can be learned in a task-independent egocentric space \textit{specific to the agent} that, when grounded with problem-specific information, are provably sufficient for planning. We demonstrate transfer in two different domains, where an agent learns a portable, task-independent symbolic vocabulary, as well as rules expressed in that vocabulary, and then learns to instantiate those rules on a per-task basis. This reduces the samples required to learn a representation of a new task.</p>

We establish a strong performance guarantee for the method, showing that it is competitive with the oracle estimator, up to a constant factor. Via in-depth case studies in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning, we demonstrate the generality and applicability of the method. We also perform comprehensive experiments, demonstrating the empirical efficacy of our approach and comparing with related approaches. In both case studies, our method compares favorably with existing methods.</p>

> <p>Neural processes (NPs) constitute a family of variational approximate models for stochastic processes with promising properties in computational efficiency and uncertainty quantification. These processes use neural networks with latent variable inputs to induce a predictive distribution. However, the expressiveness of vanilla NPs is limited as they only use a global latent variable, while target-specific local variation may be crucial sometimes. To address this challenge, we investigate NPs systematically and present a new variant of NP model that we call Doubly Stochastic Variational Neural Process (DSVNP). This model combines the global latent variable and local latent variables for prediction. We evaluate this model in several experiments, and our results demonstrate competitive prediction performance in multi-output regression and uncertainty estimation in classification.</p>

> <p>Flow-based generative models are a family of generative models which enjoy the properties of tractable exact likelihood and efficient training and sampling. They are composed of a sequence of invertible functions. In this paper, we incorporate matrix exponential into generative flows. Matrix exponential is a map from matrices to invertible matrices, this property is suitable for generative flows. Based on matrix exponential, we propose matrix exponential coupling layers which are a general case of affine coupling layers and a stable version of invertible 1 x 1 convolutions which do not collapse during training. And we modify the networks architecture to make training stable and significantly speed up the training process. Our experiments show that our model achieves great performance on density estimation amongst flow-based models.</p>

> Recently there has been increased interest in using machine learning techniques to improve classical algorithms. In this paper we study when it is possible to construct compact, composable sketches  for weighted sampling and statistics estimation according to functions of data frequencies.  Such structures are now central components of large-scale data analytics and machine learning pipelines. Many common functions, however, such as thresholds and $p$th frequency moments with $p&gt;2$, are known to require polynomial size sketches in the worst case.  We explore performance beyond the worst case under two different types of assumptions.  The first is having access to noisy \emph{advice} on item frequencies. This continues the line of work of Hsu et al.~(ICLR 2019), who assume predictions are provided by a machine learning model.  The second is providing guaranteed performance on a restricted class of input frequency distributions that are better aligned with what is observed in practice. This extends the work on heavy hitters under Zipfian distributions in a seminal paper of Charikar et al.~(ESA 2002). Surprisingly, we show analytically and empirically that ``in practice&#x27;&#x27; small polylogarithmic-size sketches provide accuracy for ``hard&#x27;&#x27; functions.

> <p>Projection-free optimization via different variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method has become one of the cornerstones in optimization for machine learning since in many cases the linear minimization oracle is much cheaper to implement than projections and some sparsity needs to be preserved. In a number of applications, e.g. Poisson inverse problems or quantum state tomography, the loss is given by a self-concordant (SC) function having unbounded curvature, implying absence of theoretical guaranteesfor the existing FW methods. We use the theory of SC functions to provide a new adaptive step size for FW methods and prove global convergence rate O(1/k), k being the iteration counter. If the problem can be represented by a local linear minimization oracle, we are the first to propose a FW method with linear convergence rate without assuming neither strong convexity nor a Lipschitz continuous gradient.</p>

> <p>The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution, which is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence machine learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many online learning schemes include drift detection to actively detect and react to observed changes. Yet, reliable drift detection constitutes a challenging problem in particular in the context of high dimensional data, varying drift characteristics, and the absence of a parametric model such as a classification scheme which reflects the drift. In this paper we present a novel concept drift detection method, Dynamic Adapting Window Independence Drift Detection (DAWIDD), which aims for non-parametric drift detection of diverse drift characteristics. For this purpose, we establish a mathematical equivalence of the presence of drift to the dependency of specific random variables in an according drift process. This allows us to rely on independence tests rather than parametric models or the classification loss, resulting in a fairly robust scheme to universally detect different types of drift, as is also confirmed in experiments. </p>

> Online recommender systems often face long delays in receiving feedback, especially when optimizing for some long-term metrics. While mitigating the effects of delays in learning is well-understood in stationary environments, the problem becomes much more challenging when the environment changes. In fact, if the timescale of the change is comparable to the delay, it is impossible to learn about the environment, since the available observations are already obsolete. However, the arising issues can be addressed if intermediate signals are available without delay, such that given those signals, the long-term behavior of the system is stationary. To model this situation, we  introduce the problem of stochastic, non-stationary, delayed bandits with intermediate observations. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm based on $\UCRL$, and prove sublinear regret guarantees for its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to learn in non-stationary delayed environments where existing methods fail.

> <p>Label smoothing is commonly used in training deep learning models, wherein one-hot training labels are mixed with uniform label vectors. Empirically, smoothing has been shown to improve both predictive performance and model calibration. In this paper, we study whether label smoothing is also effective as a means of coping with label noise. While label smoothing apparently amplifies this problem --- being equivalent to injecting symmetric noise to the labels --- we show how it relates to a general family of loss-correction techniques from the label noise literature. Building on this connection, we show that label smoothing can be competitive with loss-correction techniques under label noise. Further, we show that when performing distillation under label noise, label smoothing of the teacher can be beneficial; this is in contrast to recent findings for noise-free problems, and sheds further light on settings where label smoothing is beneficial.</p>

We prove an even stronger hypothesis (as was also conjectured in Ramanujan et al., 2019), showing that for every bounded distribution and every target network with bounded weights, a sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains a subnetwork with roughly the same accuracy as the target network, without any further training. </p>

> <p>Stochastic linear bandits are a natural and well-studied model for structured exploration/exploitation problems and are widely used in applications such as on-line marketing and recommendation. One of the main challenges faced by practitioners hoping to apply existing algorithms is that usually the feedback is randomly delayed and delays are only partially observable. For example, while a purchase is usually observable some time after the display, the decision of not buying is never explicitly sent to the system. In other words, the learner only observes delayed positive events. We formalize this problem as a novel stochastic delayed linear bandit and propose OTFLinUCB and OTFLinTS, two computationally efficient algorithms able to integrate new information as it becomes available and to deal with the permanently censored feedback. We prove optimal O(d\sqrt{T}) bounds on the regret of the first algorithm and study the dependency on delay-dependent parameters.

> <p>The estimation of treatment effects is a pervasive problem in medicine. Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational data assume that there are no hidden confounders. This assumption is not testable in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects in the presence of multi-cause hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer substitute confounders that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent.  Then it performs causal inference using the substitute confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the Time Series Deconfounder. Using both simulations and real data to show the effectiveness of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses in longitudinal data. </p>

> <p>We introduce Negative Sampling in Semi-Supervised Learning (NS^3L), a simple, fast, easy to tune algorithm for semi-supervised learning (SSL). NS^3L is motivated by the success of negative sampling/contrastive estimation. We demonstrate that adding the NS^3L loss to state-of-the-art SSL algorithms, such as the Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT), significantly improves upon vanilla VAT and its variant, VAT with Entropy Minimization. By adding the NS^3L loss to MixMatch, the current state-of-the-art approach on semi-supervised tasks, we observe significant improvements over vanilla MixMatch. We conduct extensive experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and STL10 benchmark datasets. Finally, we perform an ablation study for NS3L regarding its hyperparameter tuning.</p>

> <p>This work considers the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of tensors using proximally regularized sketched alternating least squares algorithms. First, it establishes a sublinear rate of convergence for proximally regularized sketched CPD algorithms under two natural conditions that are known to be satisfied by many popular forms of sketching. Second, it demonstrates that the iterative nature of CPD algorithms can be exploited algorithmically to choose more performant sketching rates. This is accomplished by introducing CPD-MWU, a proximally-regularized sketched alternating least squares algorithm that adaptively selects the sketching rate at each iteration. On both synthetic and real data we observe that for noisy tensors CPD-MWU produces decompositions of comparable accuracy to the standard CPD decomposition in less time, often half the time; for ill-conditioned tensors, given the same time budget, CPD-MWU produces decompositions with an order-of-magnitude lower relative error. For a representative real- world dataset CPD-MWU produces residual errors on average 20% lower than CPRAND-MIX and 44% lower than SPALS, two recent sketched CPD algorithms.</p>

> <p>Differential privacy (DP) is a formal notion for quantifying the privacy loss of algorithms.  Algorithms in the central model of DP achieve high accuracy but make the strongest trust assumptions whereas those in the local DP model make the weakest trust assumptions but incur substantial accuracy loss. The shuffled DP model [Bittau et al 2017, Erlingsson et al 2019, Cheu et al 19] has recently emerged as a feasible middle ground between the central and local models, providing stronger trust assumptions than the former while promising higher accuracies than the latter.</p>  <p>In this paper, we obtain practical communication-efficient algorithms in the shuffled DP model for two basic aggregation primitives: 1) binary summation, and 2) histograms over a moderate number of buckets.  Our algorithms achieve accuracy that is arbitrarily close to that of central DP algorithms with an expected communication per user essentially matching what is needed without any privacy constraints!</p>  <p>We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by experimentally evaluating them and comparing their performance to several widely-used protocols such as Randomized Response [Warner 1965] and RAPPOR [Erlingsson et al. 2014].</p>

> <p>It has long been argued that minibatch stochastic gradient descent can generalize better than large batch gradient descent in deep neural networks. However recent papers have questioned this claim, arguing that this effect is simply a consequence of suboptimal hyperparameter tuning or insufficient compute budgets when the batch size is large. In this paper, we perform carefully designed experiments and rigorous hyperparameter sweeps on a range of popular models, which verify that small or moderately large batch sizes can substantially outperform very large batches on the test set. This occurs even when both models are trained for the same number of iterations and large batches achieve smaller training losses. Our results confirm that the noise in stochastic gradients can enhance generalization. We study how the optimal learning rate schedule changes as the epoch budget grows, and we provide a theoretical account of our observations based on the stochastic differential equation perspective of SGD dynamics.</p>

> Policy gradient methods are a class of powerful algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL). More recently, some variance reduced policy gradient methods have been developed to improve sample efficiency and obtain a near-optimal sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of non-concave performance function in model-free RL. However, the practical performances of these variance reduced policy gradient methods are not consistent with their near-optimal sample complexity, because these methods require large batches and strict learning rates to achieve this optimal complexity. In the paper, thus, we propose a class of efficient momentum-based policy gradient methods, which use adaptive learning rates and do not require large batches. Specifically, we propose a fast important-sampling momentum-based policy gradient (IS-MBPG) method by using the important sampling technique. Meanwhile, we also propose a fast hessian-aided momentum-based policy gradient (HA-MBPG) method via using the semi-hessian information. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our algorithms also have the sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-3})$, as the existing best policy gradient methods. In the experiments, we use some benchmark tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithms.

> <p>Bayesian optimization has demonstrated impressive success in finding the optimum input xâ and output f â = f(xâ) = max f(x) of a black-box function f . In some applications, however, the optimum output is known in advance and the goal is to find the corresponding optimum input. Existing work in Bayesian optimization (BO) has not effectively exploited the knowledge of f â for optimization. In this paper, we consider a new setting in BO in which the knowledge of the optimum output is available. Our goal is to exploit the knowledge about f â to search for the input xâ efficiently. To achieve this goal, we first transform the Gaussian process surrogate using the information about the optimum output. Then, we propose two acquisition functions, called confidence bound minimization and expected regret minimization, which exploit the knowledge about the optimum output to identify the optimum input more efficient. We show that our approaches work intuitively and quantitatively better performance against standard BO methods. We demonstrate real applications in tuning a deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the CartPole problem and XGBoost on Skin Segmentation dataset in which the optimum values are publicly available.</p>

> <p>We consider the optimistic score ratio for robust  Bayesian classification when the class-conditional distribution of the features is not perfectly known. The optimistic score searches for the distribution that is most plausible to explain the observed test sample among all distributions belonging to the class-dependent ambiguity set which is prescribed using a moment-based divergence. We show that the classification approach using optimistic score ratio is conceptually attractive, delivers rigorous statistical guarantees and is computationally tractable. We showcase the power of the proposed optimistic score ratio classifier on both synthetic and empirical data.</p>

> In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm for regression problems called \textit{boosted histogram transform for regression} (BHTR) based on histogram transforms composed of random rotations, stretchings, and translations. From the theoretical perspective, we first prove fast convergence rates for BHTR under the assumption that the target function lies in the spaces $C^{0,\alpha}$. Moreover, if the target function resides in the subspace $C^{1,\alpha}$, by establishing the upper bound of the convergence rate for the boosted regressor, i.e. BHTR, and the lower bound for base regressors, i.e. histogram transform regressors (HTR), we manage to explain the benefits of the boosting procedure. In the experiments, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms such as gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), Breiman&#x27;s forest, and kernel-based methods, our BHTR algorithm shows promising performance on both synthetic and real datasets.

> <p>Significant work has been recently dedicated to the stochastic delayed bandit setting because of its relevance in applications. The applicability of existing algorithms is however restricted by the fact that strong assumptions are often made on the delay distributions, such as full observability, restrictive shape constraints, or uniformity over arms. In this work, we weaken them significantly and only assume that there is a bound on the tail of the delay. In particular, we cover the important case where the delay distributions vary across arms, and the case where the delays are heavy-tailed. Addressing these difficulties, we propose a simple but efficient UCB-based algorithm called the PATIENTBANDITS. We provide both problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds on the regret as well as performance lower bounds.</p>

> <p>Bayesian optimization is an effective method for finding extrema of a black-box function. We propose a new type of Bayesian optimization for learning user preferences in high-dimensional spaces. The central assumption is that the underlying objective function cannot be evaluated directly, but instead a minimizer along a projection can be queried, which we call a projective preferential query. The form of the query allows for feedback that is natural for a human to give, and which enables interaction. This is demonstrated in a user experiment in which the user feedback comes in the form of optimal position and orientation of a molecule adsorbing to a surface. We demonstrate that our framework is able to find a global minimum of a high-dimensional black-box function, which is an infeasible task for existing preferential Bayesian optimization frameworks that are based on pairwise comparisons.</p>

> We take a more rigorous look at Relativistic Generative Adversarial Networks (RGANs) and prove that the objective function of the discriminator is a statistical divergence for any concave function $f$ with minimal properties ($f(0)=0$, $f&#x27;(0) \neq 0$, $\sup_x f(x)&gt;0$). We devise additional variants of relativistic $f$-divergences. We show that the Wasserstein distance is weaker than $f$-divergences which are weaker than relativistic $f$-divergences. Given the good performance of RGANs, this suggests that Wasserstein GAN does not performs well primarily because of the weak metric, but rather because of regularization and the use of a relativistic discriminator. We introduce the minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for Relativistic paired GANs (RpGANs; originally called RGANs which could bring confusion) and show that it does not perform better. We show that the estimator of Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs) is asymptotically unbiased and that the finite-sample bias is small; removing this bias does not improve performance.

> <p>Graphical modeling has been broadly useful for exploring the dependence structure among features in a dataset. However, the strength of graphical modeling hinges on our ability to encode and estimate conditional dependencies. In particular, commonly used measures such as partial correlation are only meaningful under strongly parametric (in this case, multivariate Gaussian) assumptions. These assumptions are unverifiable, and there is often little reason to believe they hold in practice. In this paper, we instead consider 3 non-parametric measures of conditional dependence. These measures are meaningful without structural assumptions on the multivariate distribution of the data. In addition, we show that for 2 of these measures there are simple, strong plug-in estimators that require only the estimation of a conditional mean. These plug-in estimators (1) are asymptotically linear and non-parametrically efficient, (2) allow incorporation of flexible machine learning techniques for conditional mean estimation, and (3) enable the construction of valid Wald-type confidence intervals. In addition, by leveraging the influence function of these estimators, one can obtain intervals with simultaneous coverage guarantees for all pairs of features.</p>

> <p>We propose a neural information processing system which is obtained by re-purposing the function of a biological neural circuit model to govern simulated and real-world control tasks. Inspired by the structure of the nervous system of the soil-worm, C. elegans, we introduce ordinary neural circuits (ONCs), defined as the model of biological neural circuits reparameterized for the control of alternative tasks. We first demonstrate that ONCs realize networks with higher maximum flow compared to arbitrary wired networks. We then learn instances of ONCs to control a series of robotic tasks, including the autonomous parking of a real-world rover robot. For reconfiguration of the purpose of the neural circuit, we adopt a search-based optimization algorithm. Ordinary neural circuits perform on par and, in some cases, significantly surpass the performance of contemporary deep learning models. ONC networks are compact, 77% sparser than their counterpart neural controllers, and their neural dynamics are fully interpretable at the cell-level.</p>

> <p>Spectral functions of large matrices contains important structural information about the underlying data, and is thus becoming increasingly important. Many times, large matrices representing real-world data are sparse or doubly sparse (i.e., sparse in both rows and columns), and are accessed as a stream of updates, typically organized in row-order. In this setting, where space (memory) is the limiting resource, all known algorithms require space that is polynomial in the dimension of the matrix, even for sparse matrices. We address this challenge by providing the first algorithms whose space requirement is independent of the matrix dimension, assuming the matrix is doubly-sparse and presented in row-order. Our algorithms approximate the Schatten p-norms, which we use in turn to approximate other spectral functions, such as logarithm of the determinant, trace of matrix inverse, and Estrada index. We validate these theoretical performance bounds by numerical experiments on real-world matrices representing social networks. We further prove that multiple passes are unavoidable in this setting, and show extensions of our primary technique, including a trade-off between space requirements and number of passes.</p>

> <p>The choice of the control frequency of a system has a relevant impact on the ability of \emph{reinforcement learning algorithms} to learn a highly performing policy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of \emph{action persistence} that consists in the repetition of an action for a fixed number of decision steps, having the effect of modifying the control frequency. We start analyzing how action persistence affects the performance of the optimal policy, and then we present a novel algorithm, \emph{Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration} (PFQI), that extends FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal value function at a given persistence. After having provided a theoretical study of PFQI and a heuristic approach to identify the optimal persistence, we present an experimental campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence and proving the effectiveness of our persistence selection method.</p>

We assume there is a fixed ``comparison graph'' and every neighboring pair of items is compared k times. We will study the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model,  where the probability that item i wins a  comparison against j equals w<em>i/(w</em>i + w<em>j).  We are interested in how the expected error in estimating the vector w = (w</em>1, ... , w_n) behaves in the regime when the number of comparisons k is large.</p>  <p>Our contribution is the determination of the minimax rate up to a constant factor. We   show that this rate is achieved by a simple algorithm based on weighted least squares, with weights determined from the empirical outcomes of the comparisons.

> <p>We propose the Interferometric Graph Transform (IGT), which is a new class of deep unsupervised graph convolutional neural network for building graph representations. Our first contribution is to propose a generic, complex-valued spectral graph architecture obtained from a generalization of the Euclidean Fourier transform. We show that our learned representation consists of both discriminative and invariant features, thanks to a novel greedy concave objective. From our experiments, we conclude that our learning procedure exploits the topology of the spectral domain, which is normally a flaw of spectral methods, and in particular our method can recover an analytic operator for vision tasks. We test our algorithm on various and challenging tasks such as image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10), community detection (Authorship, Facebook graph) and action recognition from 3D skeletons videos (SBU, NTU), exhibiting a new state-of-the-art in spectral graph unsupervised settings.</p>

> <p>We present a Bayesian non-parametric way of inferring stochastic differential equations for both regression tasks and continuous-time dynamical modelling. The work has high emphasis on the stochastic part of the differential equation, also known as the diffusion, and modelling it by means of Wishart processes. Further, we present a semiparametric approach that allows the framework to scale to high dimensions. This successfully leads us onto how to model both latent and autoregressive temporal systems with conditional heteroskedastic noise. We provide experimental evidence that modelling diffusion often improves performance and that this randomness in the differential equation can be essential to avoid overfitting.</p>

> <p>The objective of a reinforcement learning agent is to behave so as to maximise the sum of a suitable scalar function of state: the reward. These rewards are typically given and immutable. In this paper, we instead consider the proposition that the reward function itself can be a good locus of learned knowledge. To investigate this, we propose a scalable meta-gradient framework for learning useful intrinsic reward functions across multiple lifetimes of experience. Through several proof-of-concept experiments, we show that it is feasible to learn and capture knowledge about long-term exploration and exploitation into a reward function. Furthermore, we show that unlike policy transfer methods that capture <code>how'' the agent should behave, the learned reward functions can generalise to other kinds of agents and to changes in the dynamics of the environment by capturing</code>what'' the agent should strive to do.</p>

> <p>We introduce a randomly extrapolated primal-dual coordinate descent method that automatically adapts to the sparsity of the data matrix as well as the favorable structures of the objective function in optimization. Our method can update only a subset of primal and dual variables with sparse data, and it can provably use large step sizes with dense data, retaining the benefits of the specific methods designed for each case. In addition to key adaptivity to the sparsity, our method attains fast convergence guarantees in favorable cases \textit{without any modifications}. In particular, we prove linear convergence under metric subregularity, which applies to strongly convex-strongly concave problems, linear programs and piecewise linear quadratic functions. We also show almost sure convergence of the sequence and optimal sublinear convergence rates for the primal-dual gap and objective values in the worst case. Numerical evidence demonstrates the state-of-the-art empirical performance of our method in sparse and dense settings, matching and improving the existing methods over different applications with real data.</p>

> <p>Motivated by high-stakes decision-making domains like personalized medicine where user information is inherently sensitive, we design privacy preserving exploration policies for episodic reinforcement learning (RL). We first provide a meaningful privacy formulation using the notion of joint differential privacy (JDP)--a strong variant of differential privacy for settings where each user receives their own sets of output (e.g., policy recommendations). We then develop a private optimism-based learning algorithm that simultaneously achieves strong PAC and regret bounds, and enjoys a JDP guarantee. Our algorithm only pays for a moderate privacy cost on exploration: in comparison to the non-private bounds, the privacy parameter only appears in lower-order terms.  Finally, we present lower bounds on sample complexity and regret for reinforcement learning subject to JDP.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we consider matrix completion with absolute deviation loss and obtain an estimator of the median matrix. Despite several appealing properties of median, the non-smooth absolute deviation loss leads to computational challenge for large-scale data sets which are increasingly common among matrix completion problems. A simple solution to large-scale problems is parallel computing. However, embarrassingly parallel fashion often leads to inefficient estimators. Based on the idea of pseudo data, we propose a novel refinement step, which turns such inefficient estimators into a rate (near-)optimal matrix completion procedure. The refined estimator is an approximation of a regularized least median estimator, and therefore not an ordinary regularized empirical risk estimator. This leads to a non-standard analysis of asymptotic behaviors. Empirical results are also provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

> The generalized linear bandit framework has attracted a lot of attention in recent years by extending the well-understood linear setting and allowing to model richer reward structures. It notably covers the logistic model, widely used when rewards are binary. For logistic bandits, the frequentist regret guarantees of existing algorithms are $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa \sqrt{T})$, where $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent constant. Unfortunately, $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large as it scales exponentially with the size of the decision set. This may lead to significantly loose regret bounds and poor empirical performance. In this work, we study the logistic bandit with a focus on the prohibitive dependencies introduced by $\kappa$. We propose a new optimistic algorithm based on a finer examination of the non-linearities of the reward function. We show that it enjoys a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with no dependency in $\kappa$, but for a second order term. Our analysis is based on a new tail-inequality for self-normalized martingales, of independent interest.

> <p>Many automated machine learning methods, such as those for hyperparameter and neural architecture optimization, are computationally expensive because they involve training many different model configurations. In this work, we present a new method that saves computational budget by terminating poor configurations early on in the training. In contrast to existing methods, we consider this task as a ranking and transfer learning problem. We qualitatively show that by optimizing a pairwise ranking loss and leveraging learning curves from other data sets, our model is able to effectively rank learning curves without having to observe many or very long learning curves. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to accelerate a neural architecture search by a factor of up to 100 without a significant performance degradation of the discovered architecture. In further experiments we analyze the quality of ranking, the influence of different model components as well as the predictive behavior of the model.</p>

> <p>We propose a method to fuse posterior distributions learned from heterogeneous datasets. Our algorithm relies on a mean field assumption for both the fused model and the individual dataset posteriors, and proceeds in a simple assign-and-average approach. The components of the dataset posteriors are assigned to the proposed global model components by solving a regularized variant of the assignment problem. The global components are then updated based on these assignments by their mean under a KL divergence. For exponential family variational distributions, our formulation leads to an efficient non-parametric algorithm for computing the fused model. Our algorithm is easy to describe and implement, efficient, and performs competitive with state-of-the-art when tested on motion capture analysis, topic modeling, and federated learning of Bayesian neural networks.</p>

> <p>\emph{Is there a classifier that ensures optimal robustness against all adversarial attacks?} This paper answers this question by adopting a game-theoretic point of view. We show that adversarial attacks and defenses form an \emph{infinite} zero-sum game where classical results (e.g. Nash or Sion theorems) do not apply. We demonstrate the non-existence of a Nash equilibrium in our game when the classifier and the adversary are both deterministic, hence giving a negative answer to the above question in the deterministic regime. Nonetheless, the question remains open in the randomized regime. We tackle this problem by showing that, under mild conditions on the dataset distribution, any deterministic classifier can be outperformed by a randomized one. This gives arguments for using randomization, and leads us to a new algorithm for building randomized classifiers that are robust to \emph{strong} adversarial attacks. Empirical results validate our theoretical analysis, and show that our defense method considerably outperforms Adversarial Training against state-of-the-art attacks.</p>

> <p>Tensor network (TN) decomposition is a promising framework to represent extremely high-dimensional problems with few parameters. However, it is challenging to search the (near-)optimal topological structure for TN decomposition, since the number of possible solutions exponentially grows with increasing the order of tensor. In this paper, we claim that this issue can be practically tackled by evolutionary algorithms in an efficient manner. We encode the complex topological structures into binary string, and develop a simple yet efficient genetic-based algorithm (GA) to search the optimal topology on Hamming space. The experimental results by both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can efficiently discovers the groundtruth topology or even better structures with few number of generations, and significantly boost the representational power of TN decomposition compared with well-known tensor-train (TT) or tensor-ring (TR) models.</p>

> <p>Optimization models with non-convex constraints arise in many tasks in machine learning, e.g., learning with fairness constraints or Neyman-Pearson classification with non-convex loss. Although many efficient methods have been developed with theoretical convergence guarantees for non-convex unconstrained problems, it remains a challenge to design provably efficient algorithms for problems with non-convex functional constraints. This paper proposes a class of subgradient methods for constrained optimization where the objective function and the constraint functions are weakly convex and nonsmooth. Our methods solve a sequence of strongly convex subproblems, where a quadratic regularization term is added to both the objective function and each constraint function. Each subproblem can be solved by various algorithms for strongly convex optimization. Under a uniform Slaterâs condition, we establish the computation complexities of our methods for finding a nearly stationary point.</p>

> <p>We consider the problem of finding a target object t using pairwise comparisons, by asking an oracle questions of the form âWhich object from the pair (i,j) is more similar to t?â. Objects live in a space of latent features, from which the oracle generates noisy answers. First, we consider the non-blind setting where these features are accessible. We propose a new Bayesian comparison-based search algorithm with noisy answers; it has low computational complexity yet is efficient in the number of queries. We provide theoretical guarantees, deriving the form of the optimal query and proving almost sure convergence to the target t. Second, we consider the blind setting, where the object features are hidden from the search algorithm. In this setting, we combine our search method and a new distributional triplet embedding algorithm into one scalable learning framework called Learn2Search. We show that the query complexity of our approach on two real-world datasets is on par with the non-blind setting, which is not achievable using any of the current state-of-the-art embedding methods. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by conducting a movie actors search experiment with real users.</p>

> <p>To collect large scale annotated data, it is inevitable to introduce label noise, i.e., incorrect class labels. A major challenge is to develop robust deep learning models that achieve high test performance despite training set label noise. We introduce a novel approach that directly cleans labels in order to train a high quality model. Our method leverages statistical principles to correct data labels and has a theoretical guarantee of the correctness. In particular, we use a likelihood ratio test to flip the labels of training data. We prove that the corrected labels are consistent with the true Bayesian optimal classifier with high probability. We incorporate our label correction algorithm into the training of deep neural networks and train models that achieve superior testing performance on multiple public datasets. </p>

> <p>In many real-world applications, data are often collected in the form of a stream, and thus the feature space of streaming data can evolve over time. For example, in the environmental monitoring task, features can be dynamically vanished or augmented due to the existence of expired old sensors and deployed new sensors. Besides the feature space evolving, it is noteworthy that the data distribution often changes in streaming data. When both feature space and data distribution are evolvable, it is quite challenging to design algorithms with guarantees, particularly the theoretical understanding of generalization ability. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel discrepancy measure for evolving feature space and data distribution named the evolving discrepancy, based on which we provide the generalization error analysis. The theory motivates the design of a learning algorithm, which is further implemented by deep neural networks. We present empirical studies on synthetic data to verify the rationale of the proposed discrepancy measure. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p>

> We provide a computational complexity analysis for the Sinkhorn algorithm that solves the entropic regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem between two measures of possibly different masses with at most $n$ components.  We show that the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for finding an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the UOT problem is of order  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \varepsilon)$, which is near-linear time. To the best of our knowledge, this complexity is better than the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which is of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$. Our proof technique is based on the geometric convergence of the Sinkhorn updates to the optimal dual solution of the entropic regularized UOT problem and some properties of the primal solution. It is also different from the proof for the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for approximating the OT problem since the UOT solution does not have to meet the marginal constraints.

> <p>Retrieving relevant targets from an extremely large target set under computation and time limits is a common challenge for information retrieval and recommendation systems. Tree models, which formulate targets as leaves in a tree hierarchy and associate tree nodes with trainable node-wise scorers, have attracted a lot of interests in tackling this challenge due to its logarithmic computational complexity in both training and testing. Tree-based deep models (TDMs) and probabilistic label trees (PLTs) are two kinds of representative tree models. Though achieving many practical successes, existing tree models still suffer from training-testing discrepancy: in testing they usually leverage beam search to retrieve targets from the tree, which is not considered in the training loss function. As a result, even the optimal node-wise scorers with respect to the training loss can lead to suboptimal retrieval results when they are used in testing to retrieve targets via beam search.  In this paper, we take a first step towards understanding the discrepancy by developing the definition of Bayes optimality and calibration under beam search as general analyzing tools, and prove that neither TDMs nor PLTs are Bayes optimal under beam search. To eliminating the discrepancy, we propose a novel training loss function with a beam search based subsampling method for training Bayes optimal tree models under beam search. Experiments on both synthetic and real data verify our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of estimating the distribution of effect sizes (the mean of the test statistic under the alternate hypothesis) in a multiple testing setting. Knowing this distribution allows us to calculate the power (type II error) of any experimental design. We show that it is possible to estimate this distribution using an inexpensive pilot experiment, which takes significantly fewer samples than would be required by an experiment that identified the discoveries. Our estimator can be used to guarantee the number of discoveries that will be made using a given experimental design in a future experiment. We prove that this simple and computationally efficient estimator enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties, and demonstrate its effectiveness on data from a gene knockout experiment on influenza inhibition in Drosophila.</p>

> <p>We present a sparse representation of model uncertainty for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) where the parameter posterior is approximated with an inverse formulation of the Multivariate Normal Distribution (MND), also known as the information form. The key insight of our work is that the information matrix, i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix tends to be sparse in its spectrum. Therefore, dimensionality reduction techniques such as low rank approximations can be effectively exploited. To achieve this, we develop a novel sparsification algorithm and derive a cost-effective analytical sampler. As a result, we show that the information form of MND can be scalably applied to represent model uncertainty in MND. Our exhaustive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on various benchmarks show the competitiveness of our approach over the current methods.</p>

> A well-known first-order method for sampling from  log-concave probability distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work  proposes a new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand $T_2$ inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.

> <p>In complex tasks, such as those with large combinatorial action spaces, random exploration may be too inefficient to achieve meaningful learning progress. In this work, we use a curriculum of progressively growing action spaces to accelerate learning. We assume the environment is out of our control, but that the agent may set an internal curriculum by initially restricting its action space. Our approach uses off-policy reinforcement learning to estimate optimal value functions for multiple action spaces simultaneously and efficiently transfers data,  value estimates, and state representations from restricted action spaces to the full task. We show the efficacy of our approach in proof-of-concept control tasks and on challenging large-scale StarCraft micromanagement tasks with large, multi-agent action spaces.</p>

  Jiabao Lei, Kui Jia [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2541-Metadata.json)
> <p>This paper studies a problem of learning surface mesh via implicit functions in an emerging field of deep learning surface reconstruction, where implicit functions are popularly implemented as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with rectified linear units (ReLU). To achieve meshing from the learned implicit functions, existing methods adopt the de-facto standard algorithm of marching cubes; while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the MLPs, due to the discretization nature of marching cubes. Motivated by the knowledge that a ReLU based MLP partitions its input space into a number of linear regions, we identify from these regions analytic cells and faces that are associated with zero-level isosurface of the implicit function, and characterize the conditions under which the identified faces are guaranteed to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. We propose a naturally parallelizable algorithm of analytic marching to exactly recover the mesh captured by a learned MLP. Experiments on deep learning mesh reconstruction verify the advantages of our algorithm over existing ones.</p>

> <p>Anderson acceleration is a well-established and simple technique for speeding up fixed-point computations with countless applications. This work introduces novel methods for adapting Anderson acceleration to (non-smooth and constrained) proximal gradient algorithms. Under some technical conditions, we extend the existing local convergence results of Anderson acceleration for smooth fixed-point mappings to the proposed scheme. We also prove analytically that it is not, in general, possible to guarantee global convergence of native Anderson acceleration. We therefore propose a simple scheme for stabilization that combines the global worst-case guarantees of proximal gradient methods with the local adaptation and practical speed-up of Anderson acceleration. We also provide the first applications of Anderson acceleration to non-Euclidean geometry.</p>

  John Sipple [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2557-Metadata.json)
> <p>In this paper we propose a scalable, unsupervised approach for detecting anomalies in the Internet of Things (IoT). Complex devices are connected daily and eagerly generate vast streams of multidimensional telemetry. These devices often operate in distinct modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant, etc.), and to prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Using the Concentration Phenomenon, we explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can attribute the anomaly to specific dimensions within the anomalous state vector. We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural network classifiers yield significantly higher AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art approaches against benchmark anomaly detection datasets, and a multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate control devices. Finally, we describe how negative sampling with neural network classifiers have been successfully deployed at large scale to predict failures in real time in over 15,000 climate-control and power meter devices in 145 office buildings within the California Bay Area.</p>

> <p>Machine learning algorithms are known to be susceptible to data poisoning attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to degrade performance of the resulting classifier. In this work, we propose a strategy for building linear classifiers that are certifiably robust against a strong variant of label flipping, where each test example is targeted independently. In other words, for each test point, our classifier includes a certification that its prediction would be the same had some number of training labels been changed adversarially. Our approach leverages randomized smoothing, a technique that has previously been used to guarantee---with high probability---test-time robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to a classifier. We derive a variant which provides a deterministic, analytical bound, sidestepping the probabilistic certificates that traditionally result from the sampling subprocedure. Further, we obtain these certified bounds with minimal additional runtime complexity over standard classification and no assumptions on the train or test distributions. We generalize our results to the multi-class case, providing the first multi-class classification algorithm that is certifiably robust to label-flipping attacks.</p>

> <p>CMDPs formalize the problem of safe reinforcement learning by exposing a cost signal alongside the reward and limiting its accumulation.  Lagrangian method are the most commonly used algorithms for the resulting constrained optimization problem.  Yet they are known to oscillate and overshoot cost limits, causing constraint-violating behavior during training.  In this paper, we aim to correct this shortcoming.  We begin by proposing a novel modification to the classic Lagrangian method: we add a ``proportional'' term to the Lagrange multiplier update and show that it induces favorable learning dynamics through damping.  This intuition leads to our introduction of PID control for the Lagrange multiplier in constrained RL, which we cast as a dynamical system.  We conduct extensive experiments in a deep RL setting, in which our methods set a new state of the art by dramatically reducing constraint violations while maintaining high returns.  Moreover, we show significant improvements in robustness to hyperparameters.  Unlike other recent algorithms, ours remains nearly as simple to derive and implement as the baseline Lagrangian method.</p>

> <p>This work focuses on the estimation of multiple change-points in a time-varying Ising model that evolves piece-wise constantly. The aim is to identify both the moments at which significant changes occur in the Ising model, as well as the underlying graph structures. For this purpose, we propose to estimate the neighborhood of each node by maximizing a penalized version of its conditional log-likelihood. The objective of the penalization is twofold: it imposes sparsity in the learned graphs and, thanks to a fused-type penalty, it also enforces them to evolve piece-wise constantly. Using few assumptions, we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those are the first in the context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying Ising model. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset demonstrate the performance of our method.</p>

> <p>Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP). Harnessing the transformerâs ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical. </p>

> <p>With a view to bridging the gap between deep learning and symbolic AI, we present a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that learns to form propositional representations with an explicitly relational structure from raw pixel data. In order to evaluate and analyse the architecture, we introduce a family of simple visual relational reasoning tasks of varying complexity. We show that the proposed architecture, when pre-trained on a curriculum of such tasks, learns to generate reusable representations that better facilitate subsequent learning on previously unseen tasks when compared to a number of baseline architectures. The workings of a successfully trained model are visualised to shed some light on how the architecture functions.</p>

> <p>We present a description of function spaces and smoothness classes associated with convolutional networks from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space viewpoint. We establish harmonic decompositions of convolutional networks, that is expansions into sums of elementary functions of feature-representation maps implemented by convolutional networks. The elementary functions are related to the spherical harmonics, a fundamental class of special functions on spheres. These harmonic decompositions allow us to characterize the integral operators associated with convolutional networks, and obtain as a result risk bounds for convolutional networks which highlight their behavior in high dimensions.</p>

> <p>Deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy in a broad spectrum of tasks, but rigorously quantifying their predictive uncertainty remains challenging. Usable estimates of predictive uncertainty should (1) cover the true prediction target with a high probability, and (2) discriminate between high- and low-confidence prediction instances. State-of-the-art methods for uncertainty quantification are based predominantly on Bayesian neural networks. However, Bayesian methods may fall short of (1) and (2) â i.e., Bayesian credible intervals do not guarantee frequentist coverage, and approximate posterior inference may undermine discriminative accuracy. To this end, this paper develops the discriminative jackknife (DJ), a frequentist procedure that uses higher-order influence functions (HOIFs) of a trained model parameters to construct a jackknife (leave-one-out) estimator of predictive confidence intervals. The DJ satisfies (1) and (2), is applicable to  a wide range of deep learning models, is easy to implement, and can be applied in a post-hoc fashion without compromising model accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DJ performs competitively compared to existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian baselines. </p>

> <p>Graph representation learning serves as the core of important prediction tasks, ranging from product recommendation to fraud detection. Real-life graphs usually have complex information in the local neighborhood, where each node is described by a rich set of features and connects to dozens or even hundreds of neighbors. Despite the success of neighborhood aggregation in graph neural networks, task-irrelevant information is mixed into nodes' neighborhood, making learned models suffer from sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we present NeuralSparse, a supervised graph sparsification technique that improves generalization power by learning to remove potentially task-irrelevant edges from input graphs. Our method takes both structural and non-structural information as input, utilizes deep neural networks to parameterize sparsification processes, and optimizes the parameters by feedback signals from downstream tasks. Under the NeuralSparse framework, supervised graph sparsification could seamlessly connect with existing graph neural networks for more robust performance. Experimental results on both benchmark and private datasets show that NeuralSparse can yield up to 7.2% improvement in testing accuracy when working with existing graph neural networks on node classification tasks.</p>

> <p>Graph representation learning is a ubiquitous task in machine learning where the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take high-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its local geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.</p>

> <p>Neural networks are widely used for processing time series data, yet such models often ignore the underlying physical structures in the input measurements. Recently Koopman-based models have been suggested, as a promising alternative to recurrent neural networks,  for forecasting complex high-dimensional dynamical systems. We propose a novel Consistent Koopman Autoencoder that exploits the forward and backward dynamics to achieve long time predictions. Key to our approach is a new analysis where we unravel the interplay between invertible dynamics and their associated Koopman operators. Our architecture and loss function are interpretable from a physical viewpoint, and the computational requirements are comparable to other baselines. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a wide range of high-dimensional problems, from simple canonical systems such as linear and nonlinear oscillators, to complex ocean dynamics and fluid flows on a curved domain. Overall, our results show that our model yields accurate estimates for significant prediction horizons, while being robust to noise in the input data.</p>

> <p>System identification is a key step for model-based control, estimator design, and output prediction. This work considers the offline identification of partially observed nonlinear systems. We empirically show that the certainty-equivalent approximation to expectation-maximization can be a reliable and scalable approach for high-dimensional deterministic systems, which are common in robotics. We formulate certainty-equivalent expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation. The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter. By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches.

> <p>We introduce a new approach for comparing reinforcement learning policies, using Wasserstein distances (WDs) in a newly defined latent behavioral space. We show that by utilizing the dual formulation of the WD, we can learn score functions over policy behaviors that can in turn be used to lead policy optimization towards (or away from) (un)desired behaviors. Combined with smoothed WDs, the dual formulation allows us to devise efficient algorithms that take stochastic gradient descent steps through WD regularizers. We incorporate these regularizers into two novel on-policy algorithms, Behavior-Guided Policy Gradient and Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies, which we demonstrate can outperform existing methods in a variety of challenging environments. We also provide an open source demo.</p>

  Siqiang Luo [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2637-Metadata.json)
> PageRank is a widely used approach for measuring the importance of a node in a graph. Computing PageRank is a fundamental task in numerous applications including web search, machine learning and recommendation systems. The importance of computing PageRanks in a distributed environment has been recognized due to the rapid growth of the graph size in real world. However, only a few previous works can provide a provable complexity and accuracy for distributed PageRank computation. Given a constant $d&gt;0$ and a graph of $n$ nodes and under the well-known congested-clique distributed model, the state-of-the-art approach, Radar-Push, uses $O(\log\log{n}+\log{d})$ communication rounds to approximate the PageRanks within a relative error $O(\frac{1}{\log^d{n}})$. However, Radar-Push entails as large as $O(\log^{2d+3}{n})$ bits of bandwidth (e.g., the communication cost between a pair of nodes per round) in the worst case. In this paper, we provide a new algorithm that uses asymptotically the same communication rounds while significantly improves the bandwidth from $O(\log^{2d+3}{n})$ bits to $O(d\log^3{n})$ bits. To the best of our knowledge, our distributed PageRank algorithm is the first to achieve $o(d\log{n})$ communication rounds with $O(d\log^3{n})$ bits of bandwidth in approximating PageRanks with relative error $O(\frac{1}{\log^d{n}})$ under the congested-clique model.

> <p>We propose a new algorithmic framework for learning autoencoders of data distributions.  In this framework, we minimize the discrepancy between the model distribution and the target one, with relational regularization on learnable latent prior.  This regularization penalizes the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance between the latent prior and its corresponding posterior, which allows us to learn a structured prior distribution associated with the generative model in a flexible way.  Moreover, it helps us co-train multiple autoencoders even if they are with heterogeneous architectures and incomparable latent spaces.  We implement the framework with two scalable algorithms, making it applicable for both probabilistic and deterministic autoencoders.  Our relational regularized autoencoder (RAE) outperforms existing methods, e.g., variational autoencoder, Wasserstein autoencoder, and their variants, on generating images.  Additionally, our relational co-training strategy of autoencoders achieves encouraging results in both synthesis and real-world multi-view learning tasks.</p>

> We study the stochastic contextual bandit problem, where the reward is generated from an unknown bounded function with additive noise. We propose the NeuralUCB algorithm, which leverages the representation power of deep neural networks and uses a neural network-based random feature mapping to construct an upper confidence bound (UCB) of reward for efficient exploration. We prove that, under mild assumptions, NeuralUCB achieves $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret,  where $T$ is the number of rounds. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first neural network-based contextual bandit algorithm with near-optimal regret guarantee. We also show the algorithm is empirically competitive against representative baselines in a number of benchmarks.

> <p>In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no closed-form, and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates for the estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to chose between them.</p>

> <p>The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN).This is different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by (i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and (iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions, that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN. Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN.  In particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL on PTB/WikiText-103. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/sIncerass/powernorm.</p>

> <p>Trained generative models have shown remarkable performance as priors for inverse problems in imaging.  For example, Generative Adversarial Network priors permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than sparsity priors.  Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting.  Given a trained generative model, we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios.  For the same accuracy on test images, they can use 10-20x fewer measurements.  We demonstrate that invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images.  We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.</p>

> Due to the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning problems, methods relying on sparsification or quantization of communicated messages are becoming increasingly popular. While in other contexts the best performing gradient-type  methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration to reduce the number of iterations, there are no methods which combine the benefits of both  gradient compression and acceleration. In this paper, we remedy this situation and propose the first {\em accelerated compressed gradient descent (ACGD)} methods. In the single machine regime, we prove that ACGD enjoys the rate $O((1+\omega)\sqrt{\nicefrac{L}{\mu}}\log \nicefrac{1}{\epsilon})$ for $\mu$-strongly convex problems and $O((1+\omega)\sqrt{\nicefrac{L}{\epsilon}})$ for convex problems, respectively, where $L$ is the smoothness constant and $\omega$ is the variance parameter of an unbiased compression operator. Our results improve upon the existing non-accelerated rates $O\left((1+\omega)\nicefrac{L}{\mu}\log \nicefrac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ and $O\left((1+\omega)\nicefrac{L}{\epsilon}\right)$, respectively, and recover the best known rates of accelerated gradient descent as a special case when no compression ($\omega=0$) is applied. We further propose a distributed variant  of ACGD and establish the rate $\tilde{O}\left(\omega+\sqrt{\nicefrac{L}{\mu}} +\sqrt{(\nicefrac{\omega}{n}+\sqrt{\nicefrac{\omega}{n}})\nicefrac{\omega L}{\mu}}\right)$, where $n$ is the number of machines and $\tilde{O}$ hides the logarithmic factor $\log \nicefrac{1}{\epsilon}$ . This improves upon the previous best result $\tilde{O}\left(\omega + \nicefrac{L}{\mu}+\nicefrac{\omega L}{n\mu} \right)$ achieved by the DIANA method. Finally, we conduct several experiments on real-world datasets which corroborate  our theoretical results and confirm the practical superiority of our methods.

We also introduce exact semi-definite programming representations of convolutional and fully connected linear multi-layer networks which are polynomial size in both the sample size and dimension. </p>

> <p>Individuals, or organizations, cooperate with or compete against one another in a wide range of practical situations. In the economics literature, such strategic interactions are often modeled as games played on networks, where an individual's payoff depends not only on her action but also that of her neighbors. The current literature has largely focused on analyzing the characteristics of network games in the scenario where the structure of the network, which is represented by a graph, is known beforehand. It is often the case, however, that the actions of the players are readily observable while the underlying interaction network remains hidden. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks for learning, from the observations on individual actions, network games with linear-quadratic payoffs, and in particular the structure of the interaction network. Our frameworks are based on the Nash equilibrium of such games and involve solving a joint optimization problem for the graph structure and the individual marginal benefits. We test the proposed frameworks in synthetic settings and further study several factors that affect their learning performance. Moreover, with experiments on three real world examples, we show that our methods can effectively and more accurately learn the games than the baselines. The proposed approach is among the first of its kind for {learning quadratic games, and have both theoretical and practical implications for understanding strategic interactions in a network environment.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we propose a new theoretical analysis of unsupervised domain adaptation that relates notions of large margin separation, adversarial learning and optimal transport. This analysis generalizes previous work on the subject by providing a bound on the target margin violation rate, thus reflecting a better control of the quality of separation between classes in the target domain than bounding the misclassification rate. The bound also highlights the benefit of a large margin separation on the source domain for adaptation and introduces an optimal transport (OT) based distance between domains that has the virtue of being task-dependent, contrary to other approaches. From the obtained theoretical results, we derive a novel algorithmic solution for domain adaptation that introduces a novel shallow OT-based adversarial approach and outperforms other OT-based DA baselines on several simulated and real-world classification tasks.</p>

> This paper studies the sample complexity (aka number of comparisons) bounds for the active best-$k$ items selection from pairwise comparisons. From a given set of items, the learner can make pairwise comparisons on every pair of items, and each comparison returns an independent noisy result about the preferred item. At any time, the learner can adaptively choose a pair of items to compare according to past observations (i.e., active learning). The learner&#x27;s goal is to find the (approximately) best-$k$ items with a given confidence while trying to use as few comparisons as possible. In this paper, we study two problems: (i) finding the probably approximately correct (PAC) best-$k$ items and (ii) finding the exact best-$k$ items, both under strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. For PAC best-$k$ items selection, we first show a lower bound and then propose an algorithm whose sample complexity upper bound matches the lower bound up to a constant factor. For the exact best-$k$ items selection, we first prove a worst-instance lower bound. We then propose two algorithms based on our PAC best items selection algorithms, of which one works for $k=1$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a loglog factor, and the other works for all values of $k$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a log factor.

> <p>Formation mechanisms are fundamental to the study of complex networks, but learning them from observations is challenging. In real-world domains, one often has access only to the final constructed graph, instead of the full construction process, and observed graphs exhibit complex, non-local structural properties. In this work, we propose GraphOpt, an end-to-end framework that jointly learns an implicit model of graph structure formation and discovers an underlying optimization mechanism in the form of a latent objective function. The learned objective can serve as an explanation for the observed graph properties, thereby lending itself to transfer across different graphs within a given domain. GraphOpt poses link formation in graphs as a sequential  decision-making process and solves it using an efficient maximum entropy based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. Further, it employs a novel continuous latent action space induced from node representations  to promote scalability. We demonstrate empirically that GraphOpt discovers a latent objective and a robust stochastic policy that enable construction of graphs with properties similar to those in observed graph, transfer across graphs with different characteristics, and exhibit competitive performance on conventional downstream tasks such as link prediction, without being explicitly trained on these new graphs or task.</p>

> <p>Policy learning using historical observational data is an important problem that has found widespread applications. However, existing literature rests on the crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the dataâan assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper, we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with bandit observational data. We propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a robust policy to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts. We first present a policy evaluation procedure in the ambiguous environment and also give a heuristic algorithm to solve the distributionally robust policy learning problems efficiently. Additionally, we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of our policy.</p>

> <p>Sampling is a fundamental technique, and sampling without replacement is often desirable when duplicate samples are not beneficial. Within machine learning, sampling is useful for generating diverse outputs from a trained model. We present an elegant procedure for sampling without replacement from a broad class of randomized programs, including generative neural models that construct outputs sequentially. Our procedure is efficient even for exponentially-large output spaces. Unlike prior work, our approach is incremental, i.e., samples can be drawn one at a time, allowing for increased flexibility. We also present a new estimator for computing expectations from samples drawn without replacement. We show that incremental sampling without replacement is applicable to many domains, e.g., program synthesis and combinatorial optimization.</p>

  Eric Liang, Zongheng Yang, Ion Stoica, Pieter Abbeel, Yan Duan, Peter Chen [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2693-Metadata.json)
> <p>Deep autoregressive models compute point likelihood estimates of individual data points. However, many applications (i.e., database cardinality estimation), require estimating range densities, a capability that is under-explored by current neural density estimation literature. In these applications, fast and accurate range density estimates over high-dimensional data directly impact user-perceived performance. In this paper, we explore a technique for accelerating range density estimation over deep autoregressive models. This technique, called variable skipping, exploits the sparse structure of range density queries to avoid sampling unnecessary variables during approximate inference. We show that variable skipping provides 10-100x efficiency improvements, enables complex applications such as text pattern matching, and can be realized via a simple data augmentation procedure without changing the usual maximum likelihood objective.</p>

> <p>Modern meta-learning approaches for image classification rely on increasingly deep networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance, making batch normalization an essential component of meta-learning pipelines. However, the hierarchical nature of the meta-learning setting presents several challenges that can render conventional batch normalization ineffective, giving rise to the need to rethink normalization in this setting.  We evaluate a range of approaches to batch normalization for meta-learning scenarios, and develop a novel approach that we call TaskNorm. Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate that the choice of batch normalization has a dramatic effect on both classification accuracy and training time for both gradient based- and gradient-free meta-learning approaches. Importantly, TaskNorm is found to consistently improve performance. Finally, we provide a set of best practices for normalization that will allow fair comparison of meta-learning algorithms.</p>

> <p>The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets is limited due to heavy memory and computational requirements. A variety of methods has been proposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the kernel matrix. Previous methods, however, cannot easily deal with non-stationary processes. This paper investigates an efficient GP framework, that extends structured kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary phase. We particularly treat mixtures of non-stationary processes, which are commonly used in the context of separation problems e.g. in biomedical signal processing. Our approach employs multiple sets of non-equidistant inducing points to account for the non-stationarity and retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker structure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient inference and kernel learning. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and large biomedical datasets.</p>

> <p>Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence data in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial markets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network-based point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin. Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating their relational information.</p>

> <p>Autoregressive (AR) models have been the dominating approach to conditional sequence generation, but are suffering from the issue of high inference latency.  Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce the latency by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due to a difficulty in dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation.  This paper proposes a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model learns to approximate the regularized posterior of the NAR model. In the M-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior and selects the training examples for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively guide the system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences and remedy the multi-modality problem. To our knowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation. We evaluate our method on the task of machine translation. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if not better, performance with existing NAR models and significantly reduces the inference latency.</p>

> <p>Stochastic particle-optimization sampling (SPOS) is a recently-developed scalable Bayesian sampling framework that unifies stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) algorithms based on Wasserstein gradient flows. With a rigorous non-asymptotic convergence theory developed recently, SPOS avoids the particle-collapsing pitfall of SVGD. Nevertheless, variance reduction in SPOS has never been studied. In this paper, we bridge the gap by presenting several variance-reduction techniques for SPOS. Specifically, we propose three variants of variance-reduced SPOS, called SAGA particle-optimization sampling (SAGA-POS), SVRG particle optimization sampling (SVRG-POS) and a variant of SVRG-POS which avoids full gradient computations, denoted as SVRG-POS+. Importantly, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for these algorithms in terms of 2- Wasserstein metric and analyze their complexities. Remarkably, the results show our algorithms yield better convergence rates than existing variance reduced variants of stochastic Langevin dynamics, even though more space is required to store the particles in training. Our theory well aligns with experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

> <p>Mutual information (MI) minimization has gained considerable interests in various machine learning tasks. However, estimating and minimizing MI in high-dimensional spaces remains a challenging problem, especially when only samples, rather than distribution forms, are accessible. Previous works mainly focus on MI lower bound approximations, which is not applicable to MI minimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) of mutual information. We provide theoretical analysis to the properties of CLUB and its variational approximation. Based on this upper bound, we introduce an accelerated MI minimization training scheme, which bridges MI minimization with contrastive learning and negative sampling. Simulation studies on Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions show the reliable estimation ability of CLUB. Real-world MI minimization experiments, including domain adaptation and information bottleneck, further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

  William Wilkinson, Paul Chang, Michael Andersen, Arno Solin [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2722-Metadata.json)
> <p>We formulate expectation propagation (EP), a state-of-the-art method for approximate Bayesian inference, as a nonlinear Kalman smoother, showing that it generalises a wide class of classical smoothing algorithms. Specifically we show how power EP recovers the Extended and Unscented Kalman smoothers, with the distinction between the two being the choice of method for performing moment matching. EP provides some benefits over the traditional methods via introduction of the so-called cavity distribution, and by allowing fractional updates. We combine these benefits with the computational efficiency of Kalman smoothing, and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the efficacy of various algorithms under this unifying framework. The resulting schemes enable inference in Gaussian process models in linear time complexity in the number of data, making them ideal for large temporal and spatio-temporal scenarios. Our results show that an extension of the Extended Kalman filter in which the linearisations are iteratively refined via EP-style updates is both efficient and performant, whilst its ease of implementation makes it a convenient plug-and-play approach to many non-conjugate regression and classification problems.</p>

> <p>In modern supervised learning, many deep neural networks are able to interpolate the data: the empirical loss can be driven to near zero on all samples simultaneously. In this work, we explicitly exploit this interpolation property for the design of a new optimization algorithm for deep learning, which we term Adaptive Learning-rates for Interpolation with Gradients (ALI-G). ALI-G retains the two main advantages of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which are (i) a low computational cost per iteration and (ii) good generalization performance in practice. At each iteration, ALI-G exploits the interpolation property to compute an adaptive learning-rate in closed form. In addition, ALI-G clips the learning-rate to a maximal value, which we prove to be helpful for non-convex problems. Crucially, in contrast to the learning-rate of SGD, the maximal learning-rate of ALI-G does not require a decay schedule. This makes ALI-G considerably easier to tune than SGD. We prove the convergence of ALI-G in various stochastic settings. Notably, we tackle the realistic case where the interpolation property is satisfied up to some tolerance. We also provide experiments on a variety of deep learning architectures and tasks: (i) learning a differentiable neural computer; (ii) training a wide residual network on the SVHN data set; (iii) training a Bi-LSTM on the SNLI data set; and (iv) training wide residual networks and densely connected networks on the CIFAR data sets. ALI-G produces state-of-the-art results among adaptive methods, and even yields comparable performance with SGD, which requires manually tuned learning-rate schedules. Furthermore, ALI-G is simple to implement in any standard deep learning framework and can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing code.</p>

> <p>Extrapolation -- the ability to make inferences that go beyond the scope of one's experiences -- is a hallmark of human intelligence. By contrast, the generalization exhibited by contemporary neural network algorithms is largely limited to interpolation between data points in their training corpora. In this paper, we consider the challenge of learning representations that support extrapolation. We introduce a novel visual analogy benchmark that allows the graded evaluation of extrapolation as a function of distance from the convex domain defined by the training data. We also introduce a simple technique, context normalization, that encourages representations that emphasize the relations between objects. We find that this technique enables a significant improvement in the ability to extrapolate, considerably outperforming a number of competitive techniques.</p>

> <p>In this paper we introduce a new approach to topic modelling that scales to  large datasets by  using  a compact representation of the data and by leveraging the GPU architecture. <br /> In this approach, topics are learned directly from the <br /> co-occurrence data of the corpus. In particular, we introduce a novel mixture model which we term the Full Dependence Mixture (FDM) model. FDMs model  second moment under  general generative  assumptions on the data. While there is previous work on topic  modeling using second moments,  we develop a direct stochastic  optimization procedure for fitting an FDM with a single Kullback  Leibler objective. Moment methods in general have the benefit that  an iteration no longer needs to scale with the size of the corpus.  Our approach allows us to leverage standard  optimizers and GPUs for the problem of topic modeling. In  particular, we evaluate the approach on two large datasets,  NeurIPS papers and a Twitter corpus, with a large number of  topics, and show that the approach performs comparably or better than the standard benchmarks.</p>

> <p>An important problem today is how to allow a group of decentralized entities to compute on their private data on a centralized deep net while protecting data privacy. Classic cryptographic techniques are too inefficient, so other methods have recently been suggested, e.g., differentially private Federated Learning. Here, a new method is introduced, inspired by the classic notion of {\em instance hiding} in cryptography. It uses the Mixup technique, proposed by {Zhang et al, ICLR 2018} as a way to improve generalization and robustness. Usual mixup involves training on nonnegative combinations of inputs. The new ideas in the current paper are: (a) new variants of mixup with negative as well as positive coefficients, and extend the sample-wise mixup to be pixel-wise.  (b) Experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of this in protecting privacy against known attacks while preserving utility. (c)  Theoretical analysis suggesting why this method is effective, using ideas from analyses of attacks. (d) Estimates of security and the release of a challenge dataset to allow the design of attack schemes.</p>

> We study the implicit regularization of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, when applied to the fundamental problem of least squares regression.  We leverage a continuous-time stochastic differential equation having the same moments as stochastic gradient descent, which we call stochastic gradient flow.  We give a bound on the excess risk of stochastic gradient flow at time $t$, over ridge regression with tuning parameter $\lambda = 1/t$.  The bound may be computed from explicit constants (e.g., the mini-batch size, step size, number of iterations), revealing precisely how these quantities drive the excess risk.  Numerical examples show the bound can be small, indicating a tight relationship between the two estimators.  We give a similar result relating the coefficients of stochastic gradient flow and ridge.  These results hold under no conditions on the data matrix $X$, and across the entire optimization path (not just at convergence).

> <p>We investigate the generalisation performance of Distributed Gradient Descent with implicit regularisation and random features in the homogenous setting where a network of agents are given data sampled independently from the same unknown distribution. Along with reducing the memory footprint, random features are particularly convenient in this setting as they provide a common parameterisation across agents that allows to overcome previous difficulties in implementing decentralised kernel regression. Under standard source and capacity assumptions, we establish high probability bounds on the predictive performance for each agent as a function of the step size, number of iterations, inverse spectral gap of the communication matrix and number of random features. By tuning these parameters, we obtain statistical rates that are minimax optimal with respect to the total number of samples in the network. The algorithm provides a linear improvement over single-machine gradient descent in memory cost and, when agents hold enough data with respect to the network size and inverse spectral gap, a linear speed up in computational run-time for any network topology. We present simulations that show how the number of random features, iterations and samples impact predictive performance.</p>

> <p>Graph generation techniques are increasingly being adopted for drug discovery. Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades significantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs significantly larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

  Wengong Jin, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2748-Metadata.json)
> <p>Drug discovery aims to find novel compounds with specified chemical property profiles. In terms of generative modeling, the goal is to learn to sample molecules in the intersection of multiple property constraints. This task becomes increasingly challenging when there are many property constraints. We propose to offset this complexity by composing molecules from a vocabulary of substructures that we call molecular rationales. These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest. We evaluate our model on various drug design tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty of generated compounds.</p>

> <p>Data containing human or social features may over- or under-represent groups with respect to salient social attributes such as gender or race, which can lead to biases in downstream applications. Prior approaches towards preprocessing data to mitigate such biases either reweigh the points in the dataset or set up a constrained optimization problem on the domain to minimize a metric of bias. However, the former do not learn a distribution over the entire domain and the latter do not scale well with the domain size. This paper presents an optimization framework that can be used as a data preprocessing method towards mitigating bias: It can learn distributions over large domains and controllably adjust the representation rates of protected groups and/or achieve target fairness metrics such as statistical parity, yet remains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset. Our approach appeals to the principle of maximum entropy, which states that amongst all distributions satisfying a given set of constraints, we should choose the one closest in KL-divergence to a given prior. While maximum entropy distributions can succinctly encode distributions over large domains, they can be difficult to compute. Our main technical contribution is an instantiation of the maximum entropy framework for our set of constraints and priors, which encode our bias mitigation goals, that runs in time polynomial in the dimension of the data. Empirically, we observe that samples from the learned distribution have desired representation rates and statistical rates, and when used for training a classifier incurs only a slight loss in accuracy while maintaining fairness properties.</p>

  Vincent Cohen-Addad, Karthik C. S., Guillaume Lagarde [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2751-Metadata.json)
> A classic problem in unsupervised learning and data analysis is to find simpler and easy-to-visualize representations of the data that preserve its essential properties. A widely-used method to preserve the underlying hierarchical structure of the data while reducing its complexity is to find an embedding of the data into a tree or an ultrametric. The most popular algorithms for this task are the classic &quot;linkage&quot; algorithms (single, average, or complete).  However, these methods exhibit a quite prohibitive running time of $\Theta(n^2)$.  In this paper, we provide a new algorithm which takes as input a set of points $P$ in $R^d$, and for every $c\ge 1$, runs in time $n^{1+O(1/c^2)}$ to output an ultrametric $\Delta$ such that for any two points $u,v$ in $P$, we have $\Delta(u,v)$ is within a multiplicative factor of $5c$ to the distance between $u$ and $v$ in the &quot;best&quot; ultrametric representation of $P$. Here, the best ultrametric is the ultrametric $\Delta^*$ that minimizes the maximum distance distortion with respect to the $\ell_2$ distance, namely that minimizes $\max_{u,v \in P} \Delta^*(u,v)/||u-v||_2$.&quot;  We complement the above result by showing that under popular complexity theoretic assumptions, for every constant $\epsilon&gt;0$,  no algorithm with running time $n^{2-\epsilon}$  can distinguish between inputs that admit isometric embedding and inputs that can incur a distortion of 3/2 in Lâ -metric.   Finally, we present empirical evaluation on classic machine learning datasets and show that the output of our algorithm is comparable to the output of the linkage algorithms while achieving a much faster running time.

> <p>Discrete choice models with unobserved heterogeneity are commonly used Econometric models for dynamic Economic behavior which have been adopted in practice to predict behavior of individuals and firms from schooling and job choices to strategic decisions in market competition. These models feature optimizing agents who choose among a finite set of options in a sequence of periods and receive choice-specific payoffs that depend on both variables that are observed by the agent and recorded in the data and variables that are only observed by the agent but not recorded in the data. Existing work in Econometrics assumes that optimizing agents are fully rational and requires finding a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy. We show that in an important class of discrete choice models the value function is globally concave in the policy. That means that simple algorithms that do not require fixed point computation, such as the policy gradient algorithm, globally converge to the optimal policy. This finding can both be used to relax behavioral assumption regarding the optimizing agents and to facilitate Econometric analysis of dynamic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate significant computational advantages in using a simple implementation policy gradient algorithm over existing "nested fixed point" algorithms used in Econometrics.</p>

> <p>Recent work on policy learning from observational data has highlighted the importance of efficient policy evaluation and has proposed reductions to weighted (cost-sensitive) classification. But, efficient policy evaluation need not yield efficient estimation of policy parameters. We consider the estimation problem given by a weighted surrogate-loss classification with any score function, either direct, inverse-propensity-weighted, or doubly robust. We show that, under a correct specification assumption, the weighted classification formulation need not be efficient for policy parameters. We draw a contrast to actual (possibly weighted) binary classification, where correct specification implies a parametric model, while for policy learning it only implies a semi-parametric model. In light of this, we instead propose an estimation approach based on generalized method of moments, which is efficient for the policy parameters. We propose a particular method based on recent developments on solving moment problems using neural networks and demonstrate the efficiency and regret benefits of this method empirically.</p>

> <p>Likelihood-free methods perform parameter inference in stochastic simulator models where evaluating the likelihood is intractable but sampling synthetic data is possible. One class of methods for this likelihood-free problem uses a classifier to distinguish between pairs of parameter-observation samples generated using the simulator and samples drawn from some reference distribution, implicitly learning a density ratio proportional to the likelihood. Another popular class of methods proposes to fit a conditional distribution to the parameter posterior directly, and a particular recent variant allows for the use of flexible neural density estimators for this task. In this work, we show that both of these approaches can be unified under a general contrastive learning scheme, and clarify how they should be run and compared.</p>

> <p>Regularization for optimization is a crucial technique to avoid overfitting in machine learning. In order to obtain the best performance, we usually train a model by tuning the regularization parameters. It becomes costly, however, when a single round of training takes significant amount of time. Very recently, Neu and Rosasco show that if we run stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on linear regression problems, then by averaging the SGD iterates properly, we obtain a regularized solution. It left open whether the same phenomenon can be achieved for other optimization problems and algorithms. In this paper, we establish a complete theory by showing an averaging scheme that provably converts the iterates of SGD on an arbitrary strongly convex and smooth objective function to its regularized counterpart with an adjustable regularization parameter. Our approaches can be used for accelerated and preconditioned optimization methods as well. We further show that the same methods work empirically on more general optimization objectives including neural networks. In sum, we obtain adjustable regularization for free for a large class of optimization problems and resolve an open question raised by Neu and Rosasco.</p>

> <p>The standard risk minimization paradigm of machine learning is brittle when operating in environments whose test distributions are different from the training distribution due to spurious correlations. Training on data from many environments and finding invariant predictors reduces the effect of spurious features by concentrating models on features that have a causal relationship with the outcome. In this work, we pose such invariant risk minimization as finding the Nash equilibrium of an ensemble game among several environments. By doing so, we develop a simple training algorithm that uses best response dynamics and, in our experiments, yields similar or better empirical accuracy with much lower variance than the challenging bi-level optimization problem of Arjovsky et.al 2019. One key theoretical contribution is showing that the set of Nash equilibria for the proposed game are equivalent to the set of invariant predictors for any finite number of environments, even with nonlinear classifiers and transformations. As a result, our method also retains the generalization guarantees to a large set of environments shown in Arjovsky et.al 2019. The proposed algorithm adds to the collection of successful game-theoretic machine learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks.</p>

> <p>In video prediction tasks, one major challenge is to capture the multi-modal nature of future contents and dynamics. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that can predict diverse and plausible future states. The key insight is that the potential distribution of a sequence could be approximated with analogous ones in a repertoire of training pool, namely, expert examples. By further incorporating a novel optimization scheme into the training procedure, plausible and diverse predictions can be sampled efficiently from distribution constructed from the retrieved examples.  Meanwhile, our method could be seamlessly integrated with existing stochastic predictive models; significant enhancement is observed with comprehensive experiments in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. We also demonstrate the generalization ability to predict the motion of unseen class, i.e., without access to corresponding data during training phase.</p>

> <p>We propose learning discrete structured representations from unlabeled data by maximizing the mutual information between a structured latent variable and a target variable. Calculating mutual information is intractable in this setting. Our key technical contribution is an adversarial objective that can be used to tractably estimate mutual information assuming only the feasibility of cross entropy calculation. We develop a concrete realization of this general formulation with Markov distributions over binary encodings. We report critical and unexpected findings on practical aspects of the objective such as the choice of variational priors. We apply our model on document hashing and show that it outperforms current best baselines based on straight-through estimators and vector quantization. It also yields highly compressed interpretable representations.</p>

  Lin Yang, Mengdi Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2789-Metadata.json)
> Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the state-action space is large. A common practice is to parameterize the high-dimensional value and policy functions using given features. However existing methods either have no theoretical guarantee or suffer a regret that is exponential in the planning horizon $H$.In this paper, we propose an online RL algorithm, namely the MatrixRL, that leverages ideas from linear bandit  to learn a low-dimensional representation of the probability  transition model while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff. We show that MatrixRL achieves a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2d\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $d$ is the number of features, independent with the number of state-action pairs. MatrixRL has an equivalent kernelized version, which is able to work with an arbitrary kernel Hilbert space without using explicit features. In this case, the kernelized MatrixRL satisfies a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2\wt{d}\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$, where $\wt{d}$ is the effective dimension of the kernel space.

> Recent works have partly attributed the generalization ability of over-parameterized neural networks to frequency bias -- networks trained with gradient descent on data drawn from a uniform distribution find a low frequency fit before high frequency ones. As realistic training sets are not drawn from a uniform distribution, we here use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) model to explore the effect of variable density on training dynamics. Our results, which combine analytic and empirical observations, show that when learning a pure harmonic function of frequency $\kappa$, convergence at a point $\x \in \Sphere^{d-1}$ occurs in time $O(\kappa^d/p(\x))$ where $p(\x)$ denotes the local density at $\x$. Specifically, for data in $\Sphere^1$ we analytically derive the eigenfunctions of the kernel associated with the NTK for two-layer networks. We further prove convergence results for deep, fully connected networks with respect to the spectral decomposition of the NTK. Our empirical study highlights similarities and differences between deep and shallow networks in this model.

> <p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found tremendous success in simulated domains, they often cannot directly be applied to physical systems, especially in cases where there are hard constraints to satisfy (e.g. on safety or resources). In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any behavior as long as it maximizes rewards, but in the real world, undesired behavior can damage either the system or the agent in a way that breaks the learning process itself. In this work, we model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and provide a new on-policy formulation for solving it. A key contribution of our approach is to translate cumulative cost constraints into state-based constraints. Through this, we define a safe policy improvement method which maximizes returns while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every step. We provide theoretical guarantees under which the agent converges while ensuring safety over the course of training. We also highlight the computational advantages of this approach. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on safe navigation tasks and in safety-constrained versions of MuJoCo environments, with deep neural networks. </p>

> <p>Evidence suggests that networks trained on large datasets generalize well not solely because of the numerous training examples, but also class diversity which encourages learning of enriched features. This raises the question of whether this remains true when data is scarce - is there an advantage to learning with additional labels in low-data regimes? In this work, we consider a task that requires difficult-to-obtain expert annotations: tumor segmentation in mammography images. We show that, in low-data settings, performance can be improved by complementing the expert annotations with seemingly uninformative labels from non-expert annotators, turning the task into a multi-class problem. We reveal that these gains increase when less expert data is available, and uncover several interesting properties through further studies. We demonstrate our findings on CSAW-S, a new dataset that we introduce here, and confirm them on two public datasets.</p>

> <p>A growing body of research has shown that many classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples -- small strategic modifications to test inputs that lead to misclassification. In this work, we study general non-parametric methods, with a view towards understanding when they are robust to these modifications. We establish general conditions under which non-parametric methods are r-consistent -- in the sense that they converge to optimally robust and accurate classifiers in the large sample limit. </p>  <p>Concretely, our results show that when data is well-separated, nearest neighbors and kernel classifiers are r-consistent, while histograms are not. For general data distributions, we prove that preprocessing by Adversarial Pruning (Yang et. al., 2019)-- that makes data well-separated -- followed by nearest neighbors or kernel classifiers also leads to r-consistency. </p>

> <p>We study the important and challenging problem of controllable generation of long-term sequential behaviors.  Solutions to this problem would impact many applications, such as calibrating behaviors of AI agents in games or predicting player trajectories in sports. In contrast to the well-studied areas of controllable generation of images, text,and speech, there are significant challenges that are unique to or exacerbated by generating long-term behaviors: how should we specify the factors of variation to control, and how can we ensure that the generated temporal behavior faithfully demonstrates diverse styles?  In this paper,  we leverage large amounts of raw behavioral data to learn policies that can be calibrated to generate a diverse range of behavior styles (e.g., aggressive versus passive play in sports). Inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatic labeling functions, we present a novel framework that combines imitation learning with data programming to learn style-calibratable policies. Our primary technical contribution is a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective, and its integration with conventional imitation learning approaches.  We evaluate our framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that our learned policies can be accurately calibrated to generate interesting behavior styles in both domains.</p>

> We provide an improved analysis of normalized SGD showing that adding momentum provably removes the need for large batch sizes on non-convex objectives. Then, we consider the case of objectives with bounded second derivative and show that in this case a small tweak to the momentum formula allows normalized SGD with momentum to find an $\epsilon$-critical point in $O(1/\epsilon^{3.5})$ iterations, matching the best-known rates without accruing any logarithmic factors or dependence on dimension. We provide an adaptive learning rate schedule that automatically improves convergence rates when the variance in the gradients is small. Finally, we show that our method is effective when employed on popular large scale tasks such as ResNet-50 and BERT pretraining, matching the performance of the disparate methods used to get state-of-the-art results on both tasks.

> We provide a new online learning algorithm that for the first time combines several disparate notions of adaptivity. First, our algorithm obtains a ``parameter-free&#x27;&#x27; regret bound that adapts to the norm of the comparator and the squared norm of the size of the gradients it observes. Second, it obtains a ``strongly-adaptive&#x27;&#x27; regret bound, so that for any given interval of length $N$, the regret over the interval is $\tilde O(\sqrt{N})$. Finally, our algorithm obtains an optimal ``dynamic&#x27;&#x27; regret bound: for any sequence of comparators with path-length $P$, our algorithm obtains regret $\tilde O(\sqrt{PN})$ over intervals of length $N$. Our primary technique for achieving these goals is a new method of combining constrained online learning regret bounds that does not rely on an expert meta-algorithm to aggregate learners.

> <p>Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs achieve outstanding performance on various tasks, their high computation demand and massive number of parameters make it difficult to deploy these SOTA CNNs onto resource-constrained devices. Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune 97% parameters and 92% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and achieve a 44% reduction in run-time memory consumption and a 53% reduction in inference latency.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we present a novel and principled approach to learn the optimal transport between two distributions, from samples. Guided by the optimal transport theory, we learn the optimal Kantorovich potential which induces the optimal transport map. This involves learning two convex functions, by solving a novel minimax optimization. Building upon recent advances in the field of input convex neural networks, we propose a new framework to estimate the optimal transport mapping as the gradient of a convex function that is trained via minimax optimization. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the learned transport map. </p>  <p>Our approach can be readily used to train a deep generative model. When trained between a simple distribution in the latent space and a target distribution, the learned optimal transport map acts as a deep generative model. Although scaling this to a large dataset is challenging, we demonstrate two important strengths over standard adversarial training: robustness and discontinuity. As we seek the optimal transport, the learned generative model provides the same mapping regardless of how we initialize the neural networks. Further, a gradient of a neural network can easily represent discontinuous mappings, unlike standard neural networks that are constrained to be continuous. This allows the learned transport map to match any target distribution with many discontinuous supports and achieve sharp boundaries. </p>

> <p>While the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) has become a ubiquitous objective for variational inference, the recently proposed Thermodynamic Variational Objective (TVO) leverages thermodynamic integration to provide a tighter and more general family of bounds.  In previous work, the tightness of these bounds was not known, grid search was used to choose a `schedule' of intermediate distributions, and model learning suffered with ostensibly tighter bounds. We interpret the geometric mixture curve common to TVO and related path sampling methods using the geometry of exponential families, which allows us to characterize the gap in TVO bounds as a sum of KL divergences along a given path.  Further, we propose a principled technique for choosing intermediate distributions using equal spacing in the moment parameters of our exponential family.  We demonstrate that this scheduling approach adapts to the shape of the integrand defining the TVO objective and improves overall performance. Additionally, we derive a reparameterized gradient estimator which empirically allows the TVO to benefit from additional, well chosen partitions. Finally, we provide a unified framework for understanding thermodynamic integration and the TVO in terms of Taylor series remainders.</p>

> <p>Generating training examples for supervised tasks is a long sought after goal in AI. We study the problem of heart signal electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis for improved heartbeat classification. ECG synthesis is challenging: the generation of training examples for such biological-physiological systems is not straightforward, due to their dynamic nature in which the various parts of the system interact in complex ways. However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically plausible ECG training examples.  We perform empirical evaluation and show that heart simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG classification.</p>

> <p>A trade-off between accuracy and fairness is almost taken as a given in the existing literature on fairness in machine learning. Yet, it is not preordained that accuracy should decrease with increased fairness. Novel to this work, we examine fair classification through the lens of mismatched hypothesis testing: trying to find a classifier that distinguishes between two ideal distributions when given two mismatched distributions that are biased. Using Chernoff information, a tool in information theory, we theoretically demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, there always exist ideal distributions such that optimal fairness and accuracy (with respect to the ideal distributions) are achieved simultaneously: there is no trade-off. Moreover, the same classifier yields the lack of a trade-off with respect to ideal distributions while yielding a trade-off when accuracy is measured with respect to the given (possibly biased) dataset. To complement our main result, we formulate an optimization to find ideal distributions and derive fundamental limits to explain why a trade-off exists on the given biased dataset. We also derive conditions under which active data collection can alleviate the fairness-accuracy trade-off in the real world. Our results lead us to contend that it is problematic to measure accuracy with respect to data that may reflect bias and inequity, and instead, we should be considering accuracy with respect to ideal, unbiased data.</p>

  Mingyuan Zhang, Harish Guruprasad Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2842-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2842-Supplemental.pdf)
> The F-measure is a widely used performance measure for multi-label classification, where multiple labels can be active in an instance simultaneously (e.g. in image tagging, multiple tags can be active in any image). In particular, the F-measure explicitly balances recall (fraction of active labels predicted to be active) and precision (fraction of labels predicted to be active that are actually so), both of which are important in evaluating the overall performance of a multi-label classifier.  As with most discrete prediction problems, however, directly optimizing the F-measure is computationally hard. In this paper, we explore the question of designing convex surrogate losses that are \emph{calibrated} for the F-measure -- specifically, that have the property that minimizing the surrogate loss yields (in the limit of sufficient data) a Bayes optimal multi-label classifier for the F-measure. We show that the F-measure for an $s$-label problem, when viewed as a $2^s \times 2^s$ loss matrix, has rank at most $s^2+1$, and apply a result of Ramaswamy et al. (2014) to design a family of convex calibrated surrogates for the F-measure. The resulting surrogate risk minimization algorithms can be viewed as decomposing the multi-label F-measure learning problem into $s^2+1$ binary class probability estimation problems. We also provide a quantitative regret transfer bound for our surrogates, which allows any regret guarantees for the binary problems to be transferred to regret guarantees for the overall F-measure problem, and discuss a connection with the algorithm of Dembczynski et al. (2013). Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings.

> <p>In this paper, we address the discovery of robotic options from demonstrations in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we present a framework to jointly learn low-level control policies and higher-level policies of how to use them from demonstrations of a robot performing various tasks. By representing options as continuous latent variables, we frame the problem of learning these options as latent variable inference. We then present a temporally causal variant of variational inference based on a temporal factorization of trajectory likelihoods, that allows us to infer options in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to learn such options across three robotic demonstration datasets.</p>

> <p>We present a strikingly simple proof that two rules are sufficient to automate gradient descent: 1) don't increase the stepsize too fast and 2) don't overstep the local curvature. No need for functional values, no line search, no information about the function except for the gradients. By following these rules, you get a method adaptive to the local geometry, with convergence guarantees depending only on smoothness in a neighborhood of a solution. Given that the problem is convex, our method will converge even if the global smoothness constant is infinity. As an illustration, it can minimize arbitrary continuously twice-differentiable convex function. We examine its performance on a range of convex and nonconvex problems, including logistic regression and matrix factorization.</p>

> <p>We provide an end-to-end differentially private spectral algorithm for learning LDA, based on matrix/tensor decompositions, and establish theoretical guarantees on utility/consistency of the estimated model parameters. We represent the spectral algorithm as a computational graph. Noise can be injected along the edges of this graph to obtain differential privacy. We identify subsets of edges, named ``configurations'', such that adding noise to all edges in such a subset guarantees differential privacy of the end-to-end spectral algorithm. We characterize the sensitivity of the edges with respect to the input and thus estimate the amount of noise to be added to each edge for any required privacy level. We then characterize the utility loss  for each configuration as a function of injected noise.  Overall, by combining the sensitivity and utility characterization, we obtain an end-to-end differentially private spectral algorithm for LDA and identify which configurations outperform others under specific regimes. We are the first to achieve utility guarantees under a required level of differential privacy for learning in LDA. We additionally show that our method systematically outperforms differentially private variational inference.</p>

> <p>We consider online allocation problems with concave revenue functions and resource constraints, which are central problems in revenue management and online advertising. In these settings, requests arrive sequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker needs to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and generates revenue. The revenue function and resource consumption of each request are drawn independently and at random from a probability distribution that is unknown to the decision maker. The objective is to maximize cumulative revenues subject to a constraint on the total consumption of resources. </p>  <p>We design a general class of algorithms that achieve sub-linear expected regret compared to the hindsight optimal allocation. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual space: they maintain a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using online mirror descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover dual sub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting algorithms are simple, efficient, and shown to attain the optimal order of regret when the length of the horizon and the initial number of resources are scaled proportionally. We discuss applications to online bidding in repeated auctions with budget constraints and online proportional matching with high entropy.</p>

> <p>The proliferation of medical monitoring devices makes it possible to track health vitals at high frequency, enabling the development of dynamic health risk scores that change with the underlying readings. Survival analysis, in particular hazard estimation, is well-suited to analyzing this stream of data to predict disease onset as a function of the time-varying vitals. This paper introduces the software package BoXHED (pronounced `box-head') for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosting. BoXHED 1.0 is a novel tree-based implementation of the generic estimator proposed in Lee et al. (2017), which was designed for handling time-dependent covariates in a fully nonparametric manner. BoXHED is also the first publicly available software implementation for Lee et al. (2017). Applying BoXHED to cardiovascular disease onset data from the Framingham Heart Study reveals novel interaction effects among known risk factors, potentially resolving an open question in clinical literature.</p>

> <p>Modern neural networks have proven to be powerful function approximators, providing state of the art performance in a wide variety of applications. They however fall short in their ability to quantify their confidence in their predictions, which can be crucial in high-stakes applications involving critical decision-making. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) aim to solve this problem by placing a prior distribution over the network parameters, thus inducing a posterior predictive distribution that encapsulates any uncertainty about the prediction. While existing variants of BNNs are able to produce reliable, albeit approximate, uncertainty estimates over in-distribution data, it has been shown that they tend to be over-confident in predictions made on target data whose distribution over features differs from the training data, i.e., the covariate shift setup. In this paper, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme based on posterior regularisation, where we use information from unlabelled target data to produce more appropriate uncertainty estimates for ''covariate-shifted'' predictions. Our regulariser can be easily applied to many of the current network architectures and inference schemes --- here, we demonstrate its usefulness in Monte Carlo Dropout, showing that it much more appropriately quantifies its uncertainty with very little extra work. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method performs competitively compared to Bayesian and frequentist approaches to uncertainty estimation in neural networks.</p>

> <p>Group invariant and equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), also known as Equivariant Networks, have achieved remarkable success in learning on a variety of data structures, such as sequences, images, sets, and graphs. Using tools from group theory, this paper proves the universality of a broad class of equivariant MLPs with a single hidden layer.  In particular, it is shown that having a hidden layer on which the group acts regularly is sufficient for universal equivariance (invariance). A corollary is unconditional universality of equivariant MLPs for Abelian groups, such as CNNs with a single hidden layer. A second corollary is the universality of equivariant MLPs with a high-order hidden layer, where we give both group-agnostic bounds and means for calculating group-specific bounds on the order of hidden layer that guarantees universal equivariance (invariance). </p>

> In the presence of noisy or incorrect labels, neural networks have the undesirable tendency to memorize information about the noise. Standard regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay or data augmentation sometimes help, but do not prevent this behavior. If one considers neural network weights as random variables that depend on the data and stochasticity of training, the amount of memorized information can be quantified with the Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training labels given inputs, $I(w : \Y \mid \X)$. We show that for any training algorithm, low values of this term correspond to reduction in memorization of label-noise and better generalization bounds. To obtain these low values, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing labels. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 corrupted with various noise models, and on a large-scale dataset Clothing1M that has noisy labels.

> <p>We study optimal covariate balance for causal inferences from observational data when rich covariates and complex relationships necessitate flexible modeling with neural networks. Standard approaches such as propensity weighting and matching/balancing fail in such settings due to miscalibrated propensity nets and inappropriate covariate representations, respectively. We propose a new method based on adversarial training of a weighting and a discriminator network that effectively addresses this methodological gap. This is demonstrated through new theoretical characterizations and empirical results on both synthetic and clinical data showing how causal analyses can be salvaged in such challenging settings.</p>

> <p>Efficient optimisation of black-box problems that comprise both continuous and categorical inputs is important, yet poses significant challenges. Current approaches, like one-hot encoding, severely increase the dimension of the search space, while separate modelling of category-specific data is sample-inefficient. Both frameworks are not scalable to practical applications involving multiple categorical variables, each with multiple possible values. We propose a new approach, Continuous and Categorical Bayesian Optimisation (CoCaBO), which combines the strengths of multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimisation to select values for both categorical and continuous inputs. We model this mixed-type space using a Gaussian Process kernel, designed to allow sharing of information across multiple categorical variables; this allows CoCaBO to leverage all available data efficiently. We extend our method to the batch setting and propose an efficient selection procedure that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation whilst encouraging batch diversity.  We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world optimisation tasks with continuous and categorical inputs.</p>

> <p>We address two fundamental questions about graph neural networks (GNNs).  First, we prove that several important graph properties cannot be discriminated by GNNs that rely entirely on local information. Such GNNs include the standard message passing models, and more powerful spatial variants that exploit local graph structure (e.g., via relative orientation of messages, or local port ordering) to distinguish neighbors of each node.  Our treatment includes a novel graph-theoretic formalism. </p>  <p>Second, we provide the first data dependent generalization bounds for message passing GNNs.  This analysis explicitly accounts for the local permutation invariance of GNNs. Our bounds are much tighter than existing VC-dimension based guarantees for GNNs, and are comparable to Rademacher bounds for recurrent neural networks.</p>

> <p>Large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from very long training times, spanning from hours to weeks, limiting the productivity and experimentation of deep learning practitioners. As networks grow in size and complexity, training time can be reduced through low-precision data representations and computations. However, in doing so the final accuracy suffers due to the problem of vanishing gradients. Existing state-of-the-art methods combat this issue by means of a mixed-precision approach utilising two different precision levels, FP32 (32-bit floating-point) and FP16/FP8 (16-/8-bit floating-point), leveraging the hardware support of recent GPU architectures for FP16 operations to obtain performance gains. This work pushes the boundary of quantised training by employing a multilevel optimisation approach that utilises multiple precisions including low-precision fixed-point representations. The novel training strategy, MuPPET, combines the use of multiple number representation regimes together with a precision-switching mechanism that decides at run time the transition point between precision regimes. Overall, the proposed strategy tailors the training process to the hardware-level capabilities of the target hardware architecture and yields improvements in training time and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Applying MuPPET on the training of AlexNet, ResNet18 and GoogLeNet on ImageNet (ILSVRC12) and targeting an NVIDIA Turing GPU, MuPPET achieves the same accuracy as standard full-precision training with training-time speedup of up to 1.84Ã and an average speedup of 1.58Ã across the networks.</p>

> <p>Knowledge graphs are incomplete by nature, representing only a limited number of observed facts about the world knowledge as relations between entities. An important task in statistical relational learning is that of link prediction or knowledge graph completion to partly address this issue. Both linear and non-linear (deep learning based) models have been proposed to solve the problem, with former being parameter efficient and interpretable. Bilinear models, while expressive, are prone to overfitting and lead to quadratic growth of parameters in number of relations. Simpler models have become more standard, with certain constraints on bilinear maps as relation parameters. In this work, we propose a factorized bilinear pooling model, commonly used in multi-modal learning, for better fusion of entities and relations, leading to an efficient and constraints free model. We prove that our model is fully expressive and provide bounds on the entity and relation embedding dimensions and the factorization rank. Our model naturally generalizes TuckER model (Balazevic et al., 2019), which has shown to generalize other models as special cases, by efficient low-rank approximation without compromising much on performance. The model complexity can be controlled by the factorization rank as opposed to the cubic growth of core tensor in TuckER model when entities and relations share the same space. Empirically, we evaluate on real-world datasets, reaching on par or state-of-the-art performance. In extreme low-ranks, the model already outperforms many of the recently proposed methods.</p>

> <p>We propose a novel gradient-based tractable approach for the Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm to compute the rate-distortion function where the BA algorithm is fully parameterized. This results in a rich and flexible framework to learn a new class of stochastic encoders, termed PArameterized RAte-DIstortion Stochastic Encoder (PARADISE). The framework can be applied to a wide range of settings from semi-supervised, multi-task to supervised and robust learning. We show that the training objective of PARADISE can be seen as a form of regularization that helps improve generalization. With an emphasis on robust learning we further develop a novel posterior matching objective to encourage smoothness on the loss function and show that PARADISE can significantly improve interpretability as well as robustness to adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our model reduces standard and adversarial error rates in comparison to the state-of-the-art by 50% and 41%, respectively without the expensive computational cost of adversarial training.</p>

> <p>Sparse incidence tensors can represent a variety of structured data. For example, we may represent attributed graphs using their node-node, node-edge, or edge-edge incidence matrices. In higher dimensions, incidence tensors can represent simplicial complexes and polytopes. In this paper, we formalize incidence tensors, analyze their structure, and present the family of equivariant networks that operate on them. We show that any incidence tensor decomposes into invariant subsets. This decomposition, in turn, leads to a decomposition of the corresponding equivariant linear maps, for which we prove an efficient pooling-and-broadcasting implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this family of networks by reporting state-of-the-art on graph learning tasks for many targets in the QM9 dataset.</p>

> <p>Recently there has been growing interest in modeling sets with exchangeability such as point clouds. A shortcoming of current approaches is that they restrict the cardinality of the sets considered or can only express limited forms of distribution over unobserved data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Energy-Based Processes (EBPs), which extend energy based models to exchangeable data while allowing neural network parameterizations of the energy function. A key advantage of these models is the ability to express more flexible distributions over sets without restricting their cardinality. We develop an efficient training procedure for EBPs that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks such as point cloud generation, classification, denoising, and image completion</p>

> <p>Initialization, residual learning, and normalization are believed to be three indispensable techniques for training very deep convolutional neural networks and obtaining state-of-the-art performance. This paper shows that deep vanilla ConvNets without normalization nor residual structure can also be trained to achieve surprisingly good performance on standard image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, and COCO). This is achieved by enforcing the convolution kernels to be near isometric during initialization and training, as well as by using a variant of ReLU that is shifted towards being isometric. Further experiments show that if combined with residual structure, such near isometric networks can achieve performances on par with the standard ResNet, even without normalization at all. </p>

> A robustness certificate against adversarial examples is the minimum distance of a given input to the decision boundary of the classifier (or its lower bound). For {\it any} perturbation of the input with a magnitude smaller than the certificate value, the classification output will provably remain unchanged. Computing exact robustness certificates for neural networks is difficult in general since it requires solving a non-convex optimization. In this paper, we provide computationally-efficient robustness certificates for neural networks with differentiable activation functions in two steps. First, we show that if the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the network (curvatures of the network) are bounded (globally or locally), we can compute a robustness certificate in the $l_2$ norm efficiently using convex optimization. Second, we derive a computationally-efficient differentiable upper bound on the curvature of a deep network. We also use the curvature bound as a regularization term during the training of the network to boost its certified robustness. Putting these results together leads to our proposed {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obustness {\bf C}ertificate (CRC) and {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obust {\bf T}raining (CRT). Our numerical results show that CRT leads to significantly higher certified robust accuracy compared to interval-bound propagation based training.

> Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input&#x27;s length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\bigO{N^2}$ to $\bigO{N}$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our \textit{Linear Transformers} achieve similar performance to vanilla Transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.

> <p>It is common practice in deep learning to use overparameterized networks and train for as long as possible; there are numerous studies that show, both theoretically and empirically, that such practices surprisingly do not unduly harm the generalization performance of the classifier. In this paper, we empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and perturbation models (L-infinity and L-2). Based upon this observed effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic improvements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early stopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still occur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed overfitting.  Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning remedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and find that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains achieved by early stopping. </p>

  Zitong Yang, Yaodong Yu, Chong You, Jacob Steinhardt, Yi Ma [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2946-Metadata.json)
> <p>The classical bias-variance trade-off predicts that bias decreases and variance increase with model complexity, leading to a U-shaped risk curve. Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation of this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is {\em monotonically decreasing} as in the classical theory, the variance is {\em unimodal} or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent in the recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</p>

> <p>Detecting rare objects with a few examples is an emerging problem. Prior works show meta-learning is a promising approach. But, fine-tuning techniques have drawn scant attention. We find that fine-tuning only the last layer of existing detectors on rare classes is crucial to the few-shot object detection task. Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by a large margin on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: Pascal VOC, COCO and LVIS. Again, our fine-tuning approach establishes a new state of the art on the revised benchmarks.</p>

> Directed graphical models (DGMs) are a class of probabilistic models that are widely used for predictive analysis in sensitive domains such as medical diagnostics. In this paper, we present an algorithm for differentially-private learning of the parameters of a DGM. Our solution optimizes for the utility of inference queries over the DGM and \textit{adds noise that is customized to the properties of the private input dataset and the graph structure of the DGM}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit data-dependent privacy budget allocation algorithm in the context of DGMs. We compare our algorithm with a standard data-independent approach over a diverse suite of  benchmarks and demonstrate that our solution requires a privacy budget that is roughly $3\times$ smaller to obtain the same or higher utility.

> <p>The accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms deteriorates severely on adversarially manipulated test data. Optimal adversarial risk quantifies the best error rate of any classifier in the presence of adversaries, and optimal adversarial classifiers are sought that minimize adversarial risk. In this paper, we investigate the optimal adversarial risk and optimal adversarial classifiers from an optimal transport perspective. We present a new and simple approach to show that the optimal adversarial risk for binary classification with 0 â 1 loss function is completely characterized by an optimal transport cost between the probability distributions of the two classes, for a suitably defined cost function. We propose a novel coupling strategy that achieves the optimal transport cost for several univariate distributions like Gaussian, uniform and triangular. Using the optimal couplings, we obtain the optimal adversarial classifiers in these settings and show how they differ from optimal classifiers in the absence of adversaries. Based on our analysis, we evaluate algorithm-independent fundamental limits on adversarial risk for CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets, and Gaussian mixtures based on them.</p>

> <p>A commonly cited inefficiency of neural network training by back-propagation is the update locking problem: each layer must wait for the signal to propagate through the network before updating. In recent years multiple authors have considered alternatives that can alleviate this issue. In this context, we consider a simpler, but more effective, substitute that uses minimal feedback, which we call Decoupled Greedy Learning (DGL). It is based on a greedy relaxation of the joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We consider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the layer training, allowing for layers or modules in networks to be trained with a potentially linear parallelization in layers. We show theoretically and empirically that this approach converges. Then, we empirically find that it can lead to better generalization than sequential greedy optimization and sometimes end-to-end back-propagation. We show an extension of this approach to asynchronous settings, where modules can operate with large communication delays, is possible with the use of a replay buffer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DGL on the CIFAR-10 dataset against alternatives and on the large-scale ImageNet dataset.</p>

  Yang Li, Shoaib Akbar, Junier Oliva [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2968-Metadata.json)
> Understanding the dependencies among features of a dataset is at the core of most unsupervised learning tasks. However, a majority of generative modeling approaches are focused solely on the joint distribution $p(x)$ and utilize models where it is intractable to obtain the conditional distribution of some arbitrary subset of features $x_u$ given the rest of the observed covariates $x_o$: $p(x_u \mid x_o)$. Traditional conditional approaches provide a model for a \emph{fixed} set of covariates conditioned on another \emph{fixed} set of observed covariates. Instead, in this work we develop a model that is capable of yielding \emph{all} conditional distributions $p(x_u \mid x_o)$ (for arbitrary $x_u$) via tractable conditional likelihoods. We propose a novel extension of (change of variables based) flow generative models, arbitrary conditioning flow models (ACFlow). ACFlow can be conditioned on arbitrary subsets of observed covariates, which was previously infeasible. We further extend ACFlow to model the joint distributions $p(x)$ and arbitrary marginal distributions $p(x_u)$. We also apply ACFlow to the imputation of features, and develop a unified platform for both multiple and single imputation by introducing an auxiliary objective that provides a principled single ``best guess&#x27;&#x27; for flow models. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling arbitrary conditional likelihoods in addition to both single and multiple imputation in synthetic and real-world datasets.

> <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios are a common failure of learning agents at deployment, typically leading to arbitrary deductions and poorly-informed decisions. In principle, detection of and adaption to OOD scenes can mitigate their adverse effects. However, no benchmark evaluating OOD detection and adaption currently exists to compare methods. In this paper, we introduce an autonomous car novel-scene benchmark, \texttt{CARNOVEL}, to evaluate the robustness of driving agents to a suite of tasks involving distribution shift. We also highlight the limitations of current approaches to novel driving scenes and propose an epistemic uncertainty-aware planning method, called \emph{robust imitative planning} (RIP). Our method can detect and recover from some distribution shifts, reducing the overconfident but catastrophic extrapolations in out-of-training-distribution scenes. When the model's uncertainty quantification is insufficient to suggest a safe course of action by itself, it is used to query the driver for feedback, enabling sample-efficient online adaptation, a variant of our method we term \emph{adaptive robust imitative planning} (AdaRIP).</p>

We believe that the community will benefit from increased access to high quality training environments, and we provide detailed experimental protocols for using this benchmark. We empirically demonstrate that diverse environment distributions are essential to adequately train and evaluate RL agents, thereby motivating the extensive use of procedural content generation. We then use this benchmark to investigate the effects of scaling model size, finding that larger models significantly improve both sample efficiency and generalization.</p>

> Neural networks and tree ensembles are state-of-the-art learners, each with its unique statistical and computational advantages. We aim to combine these advantages by introducing a new layer for neural networks, composed of an ensemble of differentiable decision trees (a.k.a. soft trees). While differentiable trees demonstrate promising results in the literature, in practice they are typically slow in training and inference as they do not support conditional computation. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new sparse activation function for sample routing, and implement true conditional computation by developing specialized forward and backward propagation algorithms that exploit sparsity. Our efficient algorithms pave the way for jointly training over deep and wide tree ensembles using first-order methods (e.g., SGD). Experiments on 23 classification datasets indicate over $10$x speed-ups compared to the differentiable trees used in the literature and over $20$x reduction in the number of parameters compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining competitive performance. Moreover, experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST indicate that replacing dense layers in CNNs with our tree layer reduces the  test loss by $7$-$53\%$ and the number of parameters by $8$x. We provide an open-source TensorFlow implementation with a Keras API.

> <p>Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are among the most fundamental tools for binary classification. </p>  <p>In its simplest formulation, an SVM produces a hyperplane separating two classes of data using the largest possible margin to the data.  The focus on maximizing the margin has been well motivated through numerous generalization bounds. </p>  <p>In this paper, we revisit and improve the classic generalization bounds in terms of margins.  Furthermore, we complement our new generalization bound by a nearly matching lower bound, thus almost settling the generalization performance of SVMs in terms of margins.</p>

> <p>In order to compute fast approximations to the singular value decompositions (SVD) of very large matrices, randomized sketching algorithms have become a leading approach. However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is that the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are from the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical worst-case error bounds, which do not account for the unique structure of a given problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads to much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. In particular, this approach allows the user to inspect the quality of a rough initial SVD, and then adaptively predict how much extra work is needed to reach a given error tolerance. Meanwhile, from a computational standpoint, the proposed method incurs only minor cost, because it operates on the (small) output of a sketching algorithm, and it requires no passes over the (large) matrix being factored. Lastly, the proposed method is supported by theoretical guarantees and a very encouraging set of experimental results.</p>

> <p>Learned dynamics models combined with both planning and policy learning algorithms have shown promise in enabling artificial agents to learn to perform many diverse tasks with limited supervision. However, one of the fundamental challenges in using a learned forward dynamics model is that there exists a mismatch between the objective of the learned model (future state reconstruction), and the downstream planner or policy (completing a specified task). This issue is exacerbated by vision-based control tasks in diverse real-world environments, where the complexity of the real world dwarfs model capacity. In this paper, we propose to direct prediction towards task relevant information, enabling the model to be aware of the current task and encouraging it to only model relevant quantities of the state space, resulting in a learning objective that more closely matches the downstream task. Further, we do so in an entirely self-supervised manner, without the need for a reward function or image labels. We find that our method more effectively models the relevant parts of a scene conditioned on the goal, and as a result significantly outperforms standard task-agnostic dynamics models and model-free reinforcement learning. </p>

> <p>In this paper, we study combinatorial pure exploration for dueling bandits (CPE-DB): we have multiple candidates for multiple positions as modeled by a bipartite graph, and in each round we sample a duel of two candidates on one position and observe who wins in the duel, with the goal of finding the best candidate-position matching with high probability after multiple rounds of samples. CPE-DB is an adaptation of the original combinatorial pure exploration for multi-armed bandit (CPE-MAB) problem to the dueling bandit setting. We consider both the Borda winner and the Condorcet winner cases. For Borda winner, we establish a reduction of the problem to the original CPE-MAB setting and design PAC and exact algorithms that achieve both the sample complexity similar to that in the CPE-MAB setting (which is nearly optimal for a subclass of problems)  and polynomial running time per round. For Condorcet winner, we first design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the offline problem of finding the Condorcet winner with known winning probabilities, and then use the FPTAS as an oracle to design a novel pure exploration algorithm CAR-Cond with sample complexity analysis. CAR-Cond is the first algorithm with polynomial running time per round for identifying the Condorcet winner in CPE-DB.</p>

> <p>Maximum selection under probabilistic queries \emph{(probabilistic maximization)} is a fundamental algorithmic problem arising in numerous theoretical and practical contexts.  We derive the first query-optimal sequential algorithm for probabilistic-maximization. Departing from previous assumptions, the algorithm and performance guarantees apply even for infinitely many items, hence in particular do not require a-priori knowledge of the number of items. The algorithm has linear query complexity, and is optimal also in the streaming setting.</p>  <p>To derive these results we consider a probabilistic setting where several candidates for a position are asked multiple questions with the goal of finding who has the highest probability of answering interview questions correctly. Previous work minimized the total number of questions asked by alternating back and forth between the best performing candidates, in a sense, inviting them to multiple interviews.  We show that the same order-wise selection accuracy can be achieved by querying the candidates sequentially, never returning to a previously queried candidate. Hence one interview is enough!</p>

> <p>Reinforcement learning algorithms usually assume that all actions are always available to an agent. However, both people and animals understand the general link between the features of their environment and the actions that are feasible. Gibson (1977) coined the term ``affordances'' to describe the fact that certain states enable an agent to do certain actions, in the context of embodied agents. In this paper, we develop a theory of affordances for agents who learn and plan in Markov Decision Processes. Affordances play a dual role in this case. On one hand, they allow faster planning, by reducing the number of actions available in any given situation. On the other hand, they facilitate more efficient and precise learning of transition models from data, especially when such models require function approximation. We establish these properties through theoretical results as well as illustrative examples. We also propose an approach to learn affordances and use it to estimate transition models that are simpler and generalize better.</p>

> <p>In this contribution, we augment the metric learning setting by introducing a parametric pseudo-distance, trained jointly with the encoder. Several interpretations are thus drawn for the learned distance-like model's output. We first show it approximates a likelihood ratio which can be used for hypothesis tests, and that it further induces a large divergence across the joint distributions of pairs of examples from the same and from different classes. Evaluation is performed under the verification setting consisting of determining whether sets of examples belong to the same class, even if such classes are novel and were never presented to the model during training. Empirical evaluation shows such method defines an end-to-end approach for the verification problem, able to attain better performance than simple scorers such as those based on cosine similarity and further outperforming widely used downstream classifiers. We further observe training is much simplified under the proposed approach compared to metric learning with actual distances, requiring no complex scheme to harvest pairs of examples.</p>

> <p>Quantifying the value of data is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has multiple important use cases: (1) building insights about the dataset and task, (2) domain adaptation, (3) corrupted sample discovery, and (4) robust learning. We propose Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning (DVRL), to adaptively learn data values jointly with the predictor model. DVRL uses a data value estimator (DVE) to learn how likely each datum is used in training of the predictor model. DVE is trained using a reinforcement signal that reflects performance on the target task. We demonstrate that DVRL yields superior data value estimates compared to alternative methods across numerous datasets and application scenarios. The corrupted sample discovery performance of DVRL is close to optimal in many regimes (i.e. as if the noisy samples were known apriori), and for domain adaptation and robust learning DVRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by 14.6% and 10.8%, respectively. </p>

> <p>Balancing performance and safety is crucial to deploying autonomous vehicles in multi-agent environments. In particular, autonomous racing is a domain that penalizes safe but conservative policies, highlighting the need for robust, adaptive strategies. Current approaches either make simplifying assumptions about other agents or lack robust mechanisms for online adaptation. This work makes algorithmic contributions to both challenges. First, to generate a realistic, diverse set of opponents, we develop a novel method for self-play based on replica-exchange Markov chain Monte Carlo. Second, we propose a distributionally robust bandit optimization procedure that adaptively adjusts risk aversion relative to uncertainty in beliefs about opponentsâ behaviors. We rigorously quantify the tradeoffs in performance and robustness when approximating these computations in real-time motion-planning, and we demonstrate our methods experimentally on autonomous vehicles that achieve scaled speeds comparable to Formula One racecars.</p>

> <p>In this work, we pose a question whether it is possible to design and train an autoencoder model in an end-to-end fashion to learn latent representations in multivariate Bernoulli space, and achieve performance comparable with the current state-of-the-art variational methods. Moreover, we investigate how to generate novel samples and perform smooth interpolation in the binary latent space.  To meet our objective, we propose a simplified deterministic model with a straight-through estimator to learn the binary latents and show its competitiveness with the latest VAE methods.  Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on a random hyperplane rounding for sampling and smooth interpolation in the multivariate Bernoulli latent space.

> <p>There is a recent surge of interest in designing deep architectures based on the update steps in traditional algorithms, or learning neural networks to improve and replace traditional algorithms. While traditional algorithms have certain stopping criteria for outputting results at different iterations, many algorithm-inspired deep models are restricted to a <code>fixed-depth'' for all inputs. Similar to algorithms, the optimal depth of a deep architecture may be different for different input instances, either to avoid</code>over-thinking'', or because we want to compute less for operations converged already. In this paper, we tackle this varying depth problem using a steerable architecture, where a feed-forward deep model and a variational stopping policy are learned together to sequentially determine the optimal number of layers for each input instance. Training such architecture is very challenging. We provide a variational Bayes perspective and design a novel and effective training procedure which decomposes the task into an oracle model learning stage and an imitation stage. Experimentally, we show that the learned deep model along with the stopping policy improves the performances on a diverse set of tasks, including learning sparse recovery, few-shot meta learning, and computer vision tasks.</p>

> <p>Posterior distribution approximation is a central task in Bayesian inference. Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and its extensions have been widely used practically and studied theoretically. While SGLD updates a single particle at a time, ensemble methods that update multiple particles simultaneously have been recently gathering attention. Compared with the naive parallel-chain SGLD that updates multiple particles independently, ensemble methods update particles with their interactions. Thus, these methods are expected to be more particle-efficient than the naive parallel-chain SGLD because particles can be aware of other particlesâ behavior through their interactions. Although ensemble methods demonstrated their superior performance numerically, no theoretical guarantee exists to assure such particle-efficiency and it is unclear whether those ensemble methods are really superior to the naive parallel-chain SGLD in the non-asymptotic settings. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel ensemble method that uses a non-reversible Markov chain for the interaction, and we present a non-asymptotic theoretical analysis for our method. Our analysis shows that, for the first time, the interaction causes a faster convergence rate than the naive parallel-chain SGLD in the non-asymptotic setting if the discretization error is appropriately controlled. Numerical experiments show that we can control the discretization error by tuning the interaction appropriately.</p>

> The true population-level importance of a variable in a prediction task provides useful knowledge about the underlying data-generating mechanism and can help in deciding which measurements to collect in subsequent experiments. Valid statistical inference on this importance is a key component in understanding the population of interest. We present a computationally efficient procedure for estimating and obtaining valid statistical inference on the \textbf{S}hapley \textbf{P}opulation \textbf{V}ariable \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{M}easure (SPVIM). Although the computational complexity of the true SPVIM scales exponentially with the number of variables, we propose an estimator based on randomly sampling only $\Theta(n)$ feature subsets given $n$ observations. We prove that our estimator converges at an asymptotically optimal rate. Moreover, by deriving the asymptotic distribution of our estimator, we construct valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Our procedure has good finite-sample performance in simulations, and for an in-hospital mortality prediction task produces similar variable importance estimates when different machine learning algorithms are applied.

> Randomized smoothing, using just a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution, has been shown to produce good robustness guarantees against $\ell_2$-norm bounded adversaries. In this work, we show that extending the smoothing technique to defend against other attack models can be challenging, especially in the high-dimensional regime.  In particular, for a vast class of i.i.d.~smoothing distributions, we prove that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}})$ with dimension $d$ for $p &gt; 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence on $d$ is no better than that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using isotropic Gaussian smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the robustness radius. When restricted to {\it generalized} Gaussian smoothing, these two bounds can be shown to be within a constant factor of each other in an asymptotic sense, establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best possible results, up to a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present experimental results on CIFAR to validate our theory. For other smoothing distributions, such as, a uniform distribution within an $\ell_1$ or an $\ell_\infty$-norm ball, we show upper bounds of the form $O(1 / d)$ and $O(1 / d^{1 - \frac{1}{p}})$ respectively, which have an even worse dependence on $d$.

> <p>Sparse principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely-used dimensionality reduction tool in statistics and machine learning. Most methods mentioned in literature are either heuristics for good primal feasible solutions under statistical assumptions or ADMM-type algorithms with stationary/critical points convergence property for the regularized reformulation of sparse PCA. However, none of these methods can efficiently verify the quality of the solutions via comparing current objective values with their dual bounds, especially in model-free case. We propose a new framework that finds out upper (dual) bounds for the sparse PCA within polynomial time via solving a convex integer program (IP). We show that, in the worst-case, the dual bounds provided by the convex IP is within an affine function of the global optimal value. Moreover, in contrast to the semi-definition relaxation, this framework is much easier to scale on large cases. Numerical results on both artificial and real cases are reported to demonstrate the advantages of our method.</p>

> <p>Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning method for geometric data. Unfortunately, many clustering algorithms use global properties of the data, and there are no simple explanations for cluster assignments. To improve interpretability, we consider using a small threshold tree to partition a dataset into clusters. This leads to cluster assignments that can be explained by very few feature values in a straightforward manner. We study this problem from a theoretical viewpoint, measuring the output quality by the k-means and k-medians objectives. In terms of negative results, we show that popular top-down decision tree algorithms may lead to clusterings with arbitrarily large cost, and we prove that any explainable clustering must incur an \Omega(\log k) approximation compared to the optimal clustering. On the upper bound side, we design efficient algorithms that produce explainable clusters using a tree with k leaves. For two means/medians, we show that a single threshold cut suffices to achieve a constant factor approximation, which is a surprising result that nearly matches our lower bounds. For general k \geq 2, our algorithm is an O(k) approximation to the optimal k-medians and an O(k^2) approximation to the optimal k-means. Prior to our work, no algorithms were known with provable guarantees independent of the dimensionality and input size. </p>

> Exploration is widely regarded as one of the most challenging aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), with many naive approaches succumbing to exponential sample complexity. To isolate the challenges of exploration, we propose the following ``reward-free RL&#x27;&#x27; framework. In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories from an MDP $M$ without a pre-specified reward function. After exploration, it is tasked with computing a near-policies under the transitions of $\mathcal{M}$ for a collection of given reward functions.  This framework is particularly suitable where there are many reward functions of interest, or where the reward function is shaped by an external agent to elicit desired behavior.   We give an efficient algorithm that conducts  $\widetilde{O}(S^2A\mathrm{poly}(H)/\epsilon^2)$ episodes of exploration, and returns $\epsilon$-suboptimal policies for an arbitrary number of reward functions. We achieve this by finding exploratory policies that jointly visit each ``significant&#x27;&#x27; state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation probability under any possible policy. Moreover, our planning procedure can be instantiated by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or natural policy gradient. Finally, we give a nearly-matching $\Omega(S^2AH^2/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm in this setting.

> <p>The combination of inducing point methods with stochastic variational inference has enabled approximate Gaussian Process (GP) inference on large datasets. Unfortunately, the resulting predictive distributions often exhibit substantially underestimated uncertainties. Notably, in the regression case the predictive variance is typically dominated by observation noise, yielding uncertainty estimates that make little use of the input-dependent function uncertainty that makes GP priors attractive. In this work we propose two simple methods for scalable GP regression that address this issue and thus yield substantially improved predictive uncertainties. The first applies variational inference to FITC (Fully Independent Training Conditional; Snelson et. al. 2006). The second bypasses posterior approximations and instead directly targets the posterior predictive distribution. In an extensive empirical comparison with a number of alternative methods for scalable GP regression, we find that the resulting predictive distributions exhibit significantly better calibrated uncertainties and higher log likelihoods--often by as much as half a nat per datapoint.</p>

> Local graph clustering and the closely related seed set expansion problem are primitives on graphs that are central to a wide range of analytic and learning tasks such as local clustering, community detection, nodes ranking and feature inference. Prior work on local graph clustering mostly falls into two categories with numerical and combinatorial roots respectively.  In this work, we draw inspiration from both fields and propose a family of convex optimization formulations based on the idea of diffusion with $p$-norm network flow for $p\in (1,\infty)$.   In the context of local clustering, we characterize the optimal solutions for these optimization problems and show their usefulness in finding low conductance cuts around input seed set. In particular, we achieve quadratic approximation of conductance in the case of $p=2$ similar to the Cheeger-type bounds of spectral methods, constant factor approximation when $p\rightarrow\infty$ similar to max-flow based methods, and a smooth transition for general $p$ values in between. Thus, our optimization formulation can be viewed as bridging the numerical and combinatorial approaches, and we can achieve the best of both worlds in terms of speed and noise robustness.   We show that the proposed problem can be solved in strongly local running time for $p\ge 2$ and conduct empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graphs to illustrate our approach compares favorably with existing methods.

> <p>Attention based Transformer architecture has enabled significant advances in the field of natural language processing. In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation, which we further validate with our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling.</p>

> <p>We introduce a new measure to evaluate the transferability of representations learned by classifiers. Our measure, the Log Expected Empirical Prediction (LEEP), is simple and easy to compute: when given a classifier trained on a source data set, it only requires running the target data set through this classifier once. We analyze the properties of LEEP theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our analysis shows that LEEP can predict the performance and convergence speed of both transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced data. Moreover, LEEP outperforms recently proposed transferability measures such as negative conditional entropy and H scores. Notably, when transferring from ImageNet to CIFAR100, LEEP can achieve up to 30% improvement compared to the best competing method in terms of the correlations with actual transfer accuracy.</p>

> <p>In this paper we describe a new parallel algorithm called Fast Adaptive Sequencing Technique (FAST) for maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint k. This algorithm achieves the optimal 1-1/e approximation guarantee and is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art on a variety of experiments over real-world data sets.</p>  <p>In the past two years, following the work by Balkanski and Singer there has been a great deal of work on algorithms whose theoretical parallel runtime is exponentially faster than algorithms used for submodular maximization over the past 40 years. Although these algorithms are fast in terms of asymptotic worst case guarantees, it is computationally infeasible to use them in practice. The reason is that the number of rounds and queries they require depends on very large constants as well as high-degree polynomials in terms of the precision and confidence, causing these algorithms to be impractical even on small data sets.  </p>  <p>The design principles behind the FAST algorithm we present here are a significant departure from those of theoretically fast algorithms that have been studied in the past two years. Rather than optimize for theoretical guarantees, the design of FAST introduces several new techniques that achieve remarkable practical and theoretical parallel runtimes. More specifically, the approximation guarantee obtained by FAST is arbitrarily close to 1 â 1/e, its theoretical parallel runtime (adaptivity) is O(log(n) log^2(log k)), and the total number of queries is O(n log log(k)). We show that FAST is orders of magnitude faster than any algorithm for submodular maximization we are aware of, including hyper-optimized parallel versions of state-of-the-art serial algorithms, by running experiments on large data sets.</p>

> <p>The goal of text generation models is to fit the underlying real probability distribution of text. For performance evaluation, quality and diversity metrics are usually applied. However, it is still not clear to what extend can the quality-diversity evaluation reflect the distribution-fitting goal. In this paper, we try to reveal such relation in a theoretical approach. We prove that under certain conditions, a linear combination of quality and diversity constitutes a divergence metric between the generated distribution and the real distribution. We also show that the commonly used BLEU/Self-BLEU metric pair fails to match any divergence metric, thus propose CR/NRR as a substitute for quality/diversity metric pair.</p>

  Junzhe Zhang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3096-Metadata.json)
> <p>A dynamic treatment regime (DTR) consists of a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of intervention, that dictates how to determine the treatment assignment to patients based on evolving treatments and covariates' history. These regimes are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of the critical ingredients underlying more personalized decision-making systems. All reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal DTR in online settings will suffer O(\sqrt{|D<em>{X, S}|T}) regret on some environments, where T is the number of experiments, and D</em>{X, S} is the domains of treatments X and covariates S. This implies T = O (|D<em>{X, S}|) trials to generate an optimal DTR. In many applications, domains of X and S could be so enormous that the time required to ensure appropriate learning may be unattainable. We show that, if the causal diagram of the underlying environment is provided, one could achieve regret that is exponentially smaller than D</em>{X, S}. In particular, we develop two online algorithms that satisfy such regret bounds by exploiting the causal structure underlying the DTR; one is based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU-DTR), and the other uses the posterior sampling learning (PS-DTR). Finally, we introduce efficient methods to accelerate these online learning procedures by leveraging the abundant, yet biased observational (non-experimental) data.</p>

> <p>This paper seeks to establish a mechanism for directing a collection of simple, specialized, self-interested agents to solve what traditionally are posed as monolithic single-agent sequential decision problems with a central global objective. What makes it challenging to use a decentralized approach to collectively optimize a central objective is the difficulty in characterizing the equilibrium strategy profile of non-cooperative games. To overcome this challenge, we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each primitive agent for which we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives. We then derive a learning algorithm for the system and empirically test to what extent the desired equilibrium is achieved. The system functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment state. We also show that redundancy not only enforces credit conservation but also improves robustness against suboptimal equilibria.</p>

> <p>Language model pre-training has been shown to capture a surprising amount of world knowledge, crucial for NLP tasks such as question answering. However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity.</p>

> <p>Label distribution  covers a certain number of labels, representing the degree to which each label describes the instance. The learning process on the  instances labeled by label distributions is called label distribution learning (LDL). Unfortunately, many training sets only contain  simple logical labels rather than label distributions due to the difficulty of obtaining the label distributions directly.  To solve this problem,  we consider the label distributions as the latent vectors and  infer the label distributions from the logical labels in the training datasets by using variational inference. After that, we induce a predictive model to train the label distribution data by employing the multi-output regression technique. The recovery experiment  on thirteen real-world LDL  datasets  and the predictive experiment on ten multi-label learning datasets validate the advantage of our approach  over the state-of-the-art  approaches. </p>

> <p>We study "adversarial scaling", a multi-armed bandit model where rewards have a stochastic and an adversarial component. Our model captures display advertising where the "click-through-rate" can be decomposed to a (fixed across time) arm-quality component and a  non-stochastic user-relevance component (fixed across arms). Despite the relative stochasticity of our model, we demonstrate two settings where most bandit algorithms suffer. On the positive side, we show that two algorithms, one from the action elimination and one from the mirror descent family are adaptive enough to be robust to adversarial scaling. Our results shed light on the robustness of adaptive parameter selection in stochastic bandits, which may be of independent interest.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we propose a new loss function for linear autoencoders (LAEs) and then analytically identify the structure of the loss surface. Optimizing the conventional Mean Square Error (MSE) loss results in a decoder matrix that spans the principal subspace of the sample covariance of the data, but fails to identify the exact eigenvectors. This shortcoming originates from an invariance that cancels out in the global map. Here, we prove that our loss function eliminates this issue, i.e., the decoder converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. For this new loss, we characterize the full structure of the loss landscape in the following sense: we establish analytical expression for the set of all critical points, show that it is a subset of critical points of MSE, and that all local minima are still global. However, the invariant global minima under MSE become saddle points under the new loss. Moreover, we show that the order of computational complexity of the loss and its gradients are the same as MSE and, hence, the new loss is not only of theoretical importance but is of practical value, e.g., for low-rank approximation. </p>

> <p>Minimax optimization has found extensive applications in modern machine learning, in settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adversarial training and multi-agent reinforcement learning. As most of these applications involve continuous nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, a very basic question arises---``what is a proper definition of local optima?''</p>  <p>Most previous work answers this question using classical notions of equilibria from simultaneous games, where the min-player and the max-player act simultaneously. In contrast, most applications in machine learning, including GANs and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games, where the order of which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general not equal to maximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems). The main contribution of this paper is to propose a proper mathematical definition of local optimality for this sequential setting---local minimax, as well as to present its properties and existence results. Finally, we establish a strong connection to a basic local search algorithm---gradient descent ascent (GDA): under mild conditions, all stable limit points of GDA are exactly local minimax points up to some degenerate points.</p>

> <p>We introduce the lookahead-bounded Q-learning (LBQL) algorithm, a new, provably convergent variant of Q-learning that seeks to improve the performance of standard Q-learning in stochastic environments through the use of âlookaheadâ upper and lower bounds. To do this, LBQL employs previously collected experience and each iterationâs state-action values as dual feasible penalties to construct a sequence of sampled information relaxation problems. The solutions to these problems provide estimated upper and lower bounds on the optimal value, which we track via stochastic approximation. These quantities are then used to constrain the iterates to stay within the bounds at every iteration. Numerical experiments confirm the fast convergence of LBQL as compared to the standard Q-learning algorithm and several related techniques.</p>

> <p>Irregularly-sampled time series occur in many domains including healthcare. They can be challenging to model because they do not naturally yield a fixed-dimensional representation as required by many standard machine learning models. In this paper, we consider irregular sampling from the perspective of missing data. We model observed irregularly sampled time series data as a sequence of index-value pairs sampled from a continuous but unobserved function. We introduce an encoder-decoder framework for learning from such generic indexed sequences. We propose learning methods for this framework based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. We focus on the continuous-time case and introduce continuous convolutional layers that can interface with existing neural network architectures. We investigate two applications of this framework: interpolation and time series classification. Experiments show that our models are able to achieve competitive or better classification results on irregularly sampled multivariate time series classification tasks compared to recent RNN models while offering significantly faster training times.</p>

> <p>Performance evaluations are critical for quantifying algorithmic advances in reinforcement learning. Recent reproducibility analyses have shown that reported performance results are often inconsistent and difficult to replicate. In this work, we argue that the inconsistency of performance stems from the use of flawed evaluation metrics. Taking a step towards ensuring that reported results are consistent, we propose a new comprehensive evaluation methodology for reinforcement learning algorithms that produces reliable measurements of performance both on a single environment and when aggregated across environments. We demonstrate this method by evaluating a broad class of reinforcement learning algorithms on common benchmark tasks.</p>

  Yu-Ting Chou, Gang Niu, Hsuan-Tien Lin, Masashi Sugiyama [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3134-Metadata.json)
> <p>In weakly supervised learning, unbiased risk estimators (URE) are powerful tools for estimating the risk of classifiers when the training distribution differs from the test distribution. However, they lead to overfitting in many problem settings if deep networks are chosen as the classifiers. In this paper, we investigate reasons for such overfitting by studying learning with complementary labels. We argue that the quality of gradient estimation matters more than risk estimation in risk minimization. Theoretically, we find UREs give unbiased gradient estimators (UGE). Empirically, we find UGEs have a huge variance, though the bias is zero; their direction is far away from the true gradient in expectation, though the expected direction is the same as the true gradient. Hence we advocate to use biased risk estimators by taking into account the bias-variance tradeoff and the directional similarity of gradient estimation, and experiments show that they successfully mitigate the overfitting due to UREs/UGEs.</p>

>   Self-play, where the algorithm learns by playing against itself without requiring any direct supervision, has become the new weapon in modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) for achieving superhuman performance in practice. However, the majority of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only applies to the setting where the agent plays against a fixed environment. It remains largely open whether self-play algorithms can be provably effective, especially when it is necessary to manage the exploration/exploitation tradeoff.    We study self-play in competitive reinforcement learning under the setting of Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision processes to the two-player case. We introduce a self-play algorithm---Value Iteration with Upper/Lower Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB), and show that it achieves regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ after playing $T$ steps of the game. The regret is measured by the agent&#x27;s performance against a \emph{fully adversarial} opponent who can exploit the agent&#x27;s strategy at \emph{any} step. We also introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves a slightly worse regret of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to run in polynomial time even in the worst case. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first line of provably sample-efficient self-play algorithms for competitive reinforcement learning.

> <p>Most recommender systems (RS) research assumes that a user's utility can be maximized independently of the utility of the other agents (e.g., other users, content providers). In realistic settings, this is often not true -- the dynamics of an RS ecosystem couple the long-term utility of all agents. In this work, we explore settings in which content providers cannot remain viable unless they receive a certain level of user engagement. We formulate this problem as one of equilibrium selection in the induced dynamical system, and show that it can be solved as an optimal constrained matching problem. Our model ensures the system reaches an equilibrium with maximal social welfare supported by a sufficiently diverse set of viable providers. We demonstrate that even in a simple, stylized dynamical RS model, the standard  myopic approach to recommendation - always matching a user to the best provider - performs poorly. We develop several scalable techniques to solve the matching problem, and also draw connections to various notions of user regret and fairness, arguing that these outcomes are fairer in a utilitarian sense.</p>

> <p>Disentanglement learning is crucial for obtaining disentangled representations and controllable generation. Current disentanglement methods face several inherent limitations: difficulty with high-resolution images, primarily on learning disentangled representations, and non-identifiability due to the unsupervised setting. To alleviate these limitations, we design new architectures and loss functions based on StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019), for semi-supervised high-resolution disentanglement learning. We create two complex high-resolution synthetic datasets for systematic testing. We investigate the impact of limited supervision and find that using only 0.25%~2.5% of labeled data is sufficient for good disentanglement on both synthetic and real datasets. We propose new metrics to quantify generator controllability, and observe there may exist a crucial trade-off between disentangled representation learning and controllable generation. We also consider semantic fine-grained image editing to achieve better generalization to unseen images. </p>

> <p>Many large-scale machine learning (ML) applications need to perform decentralized learning over datasets generated at different devices and locations. Such datasets pose a significant challenge to decentralized learning because their different contexts result in significant data distribution skew across devices/locations. In this paper, we take a step toward better understanding this challenge by presenting a detailed experimental study of decentralized DNN training on a common type of data skew: skewed distribution of data labels across locations/devices. Our study shows that: (i) skewed data labels are a fundamental and pervasive problem for decentralized learning, causing significant accuracy loss across many ML applications, DNN models, training datasets, and decentralized learning algorithms; (ii) the problem is particularly challenging for DNN models with batch normalization layers; and (iii) the degree of skewness is a key determinant of the difficulty of the problem. Based on these findings, we present SkewScout, a system-level approach that adapts the communication frequency of decentralized learning algorithms to the (skew-induced) accuracy loss between data partitions. We also show that group normalization can recover much of the skew-induced accuracy loss of batch normalization.</p>

> <p>The gradient noise of SGD is considered to play a central role in the observed strong generalization abilities of deep learning. While past studies confirm that the magnitude and the covariance structure of gradient noise are critical for regularization, it remains unclear whether or not the class of noise distributions is important. In this work we provide negative results by showing that noises in classes different from the SGD noise can also effectively regularize gradient descent. Our finding is based on a novel observation on the structure of the SGD noise: it is the multiplication of the gradient matrix and a sampling noise that arises from the mini-batch sampling procedure. Moreover, the sampling noises unify two kinds of gradient regularizing noises that belong to the Gaussian class: the one using (scaled) Fisher as covariance and the one using the gradient covariance of SGD as covariance. Finally, thanks to the flexibility of choosing noise class, an algorithm is proposed to perform noisy gradient descent that generalizes well, the variant of which even benefits large batch SGD training without hurting generalization.</p>

> <p>We give safe screening rules to eliminate variables from regression with L0 regularization or cardinality constraint. These rules are based on guarantees that a feature may or may not be selected in an optimal solution.  The screening rules can be computed from a convex relaxation solution in linear time, without solving the L0 optimization problem. Thus, they can be used in a preprocessing step to safely remove variables from consideration apriori.  Numerical experiments on real and synthetic data indicate that,  on average, 76\% of the variables can be fixed to their optimal values, hence, reducing the computational burden for optimization substantially. Therefore, the proposed fast and effective screening rules extend the scope of algorithms for L0 regression to larger data sets.</p>

> Standard methods in supervised learning separate training and prediction: the model is fit independently of any test points it may encounter. However, can knowledge of the next test point $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ be exploited to improve prediction accuracy? We address this question in the context of linear prediction, showing how  techniques from semi-parametric inference can be used transductively to combat regularization bias. We first lower bound the $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ prediction error of ridge regression and the Lasso, showing that they must incur significant bias in certain test directions. We then provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ prediction error of two transductive prediction rules. We conclude by showing the efficacy of our methods on both synthetic and real data, highlighting the improvements single point transductive     prediction can provide in settings with distribution shift.

> <p>Variance-reduced algorithms, although achieve great theoretical performance, can run slowly in practice due to the periodic gradient estimation with a large batch of data. Batch-size adaptation thus arises as a promising approach to accelerate such algorithms. However, existing schemes either apply prescribed batch-size adaption rule or exploit the information along optimization path via additional backtracking and condition verification steps. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, which eliminates backtracking line search but still exploits the information along optimization path by adapting the batch size via history stochastic gradients. We further theoretically show that such a scheme substantially reduces the overall complexity for popular variance-reduced algorithms SVRG and SARAH/SPIDER for both conventional nonconvex optimization and reinforcement learning problems. To this end, we develop a new convergence analysis framework to handle the dependence of the batch size on history stochastic gradients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed batch-size adaptation scheme. </p>

  Junfeng Wen, Bo Dai, Lihong Li, Dale Schuurmans [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3172-Metadata.json)
> <p>We consider the problem of approximating the stationary distribution of an ergodic Markov chain given a set of sampled transitions. Classical simulation-based approaches assume access to the underlying process so that trajectories of sufficient length can be gathered to approximate stationary sampling. Instead, we consider an alternative setting where a \emph{fixed} set of transitions has been collected beforehand, by a separate, possibly unknown procedure. The goal is still to estimate properties of the stationary distribution, but without additional access to the underlying system. We propose a consistent estimator that is based on recovering a correction ratio function over the given data. In particular, we develop a variational power method (VPM) that provides provably consistent estimates under general conditions. In addition to unifying a number of existing approaches from different subfields, we also find that VPM yields significantly better estimates across a range of problems, including queueing, stochastic differential equations, post-processing MCMC, and off-policy evaluation.</p>

> Adversarial robustness has become a fundamental requirement in modern machine learning applications. Yet, there has been surprisingly little statistical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide the first result of the \emph{optimal} minimax guarantees for the excess risk for adversarially robust classification, under Gaussian mixture model proposed by \cite{schmidt2018adversarially}. The results are stated in terms of the \emph{Adversarial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (AdvSNR)}, which generalizes a similar notion for standard linear classification to the adversarial setting. For the Gaussian mixtures with AdvSNR value of $r$, we prove an excess risk lower bound of order $\Theta(e^{-(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)) r^2} \frac{d}{n})$ and design a computationally efficient estimator that achieves this optimal rate. Our results built upon minimal assumptions while cover a wide spectrum of adversarial perturbations including $\ell_p$ balls for any $p \ge 1$.

> <p>Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) demonstrates tremendous success in practice, especially when combined with neural networks. Different from reinforcement learning, GAIL learns both policy and reward function from expert (human) demonstration. Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether GAIL with neural networks converges to the globally optimal solution. The major difï¬culty comes from the nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization structure. To bridge the gap between practice and theory, we analyze a gradient-based algorithm with alternating updates and establish its sublinear convergence to the globally optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the global optimality and convergence rate of GAIL with neural networks for the ï¬rst time.</p>

> <p>We illustrate how game theory is a good framework to understand model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). We point out that a large class of MBRL algorithms can be viewed as a game between two players: (1) a policy player, which attempts to maximize rewards under the learned model; (2) a model player, which attempts to fit the real-world data collected by the policy player. Their goals need not be aligned, and are often conflicting. We show that stable algorithms for MBRL can be derived by considering a Stackelberg game between the two players. This formulation gives rise to two natural schools of MBRL algorithms based on which player is chosen as the leader in the Stackelberg game, and together encapsulate many existing MBRL algorithms. Through experiments on a suite of continuous control tasks, we validate that algorithms based on our framework lead to stable and sample efficient learning.</p>

> In this paper, we study (locally) differentially private Combinatorial Semi-Bandits (CSB). Compared with private Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), since the server receives more information from the user, it usually leads to additional dependence over the dimension of feedback, which is a notorious problem in private learning.  Somewhat surprisingly, we show that it is possible to remove this side-effect caused by privacy protection and nearly match corresponding non-private best results. In detail, for general CSB with $B$-bounded smooth reward function in the sense of Chen et al. 2016, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves regret bound $\tilde{\mc{O}}(mB^2\log T / \epsilon)$ over $T$ rounds under $\epsilon$-local differential privacy, where $m$ is the number of base arms. However, for Linear CSB, $B$ equals $K$, where $K$ is the maximum number of feedback in each round, and above bound has an additional $K$ compared with non-private optimal result. We then propose a different algorithm with nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{\mc{O}}(mK\log T / \epsilon)$ if one cares about $\epsilon$-differential privacy rather than $\epsilon$-local differential privacy. Besides, we also prove some  lower bounds in each setting.

> <p>Most reinforcement learning methods are based upon the key assumption that the transition dynamics and reward functions are fixed, that is, the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) is stationary. However, in many practical real-world applications, this assumption is clearly violated. We discuss how current methods can have inherent limitations for non-stationary MDPs, and therefore searching a policy that is good for the future, unknown MDP, requires rethinking the optimization paradigm. To address this problem, we develop a method that builds upon ideas from both counter-factual reasoning and curve-fitting to proactively search for a good future policy, without ever modeling the underlying non-stationarity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on problems motivated by real-world applications.</p>

> <p>Model fusion is an emerging study in collective learning where heterogeneous experts with private data and learning architectures need to combine their black-box knowledge for better performance. Existing literature achieves this via a local knowledge distillation scheme that transfuses the predictive patterns of each pre-trained expert onto a white-box imitator model, which can be incorporated efficiently into a global model. This scheme however does not extend to multi-task scenarios where different experts were trained to solve different tasks and only part of their distilled knowledge is relevant to a new task. To address this multi-task challenge, we develop a new fusion paradigm that represents each expert as a distribution over a spectrum of predictive prototypes, which are isolated from task-specific information encoded within the prototype distribution. The task-agnostic prototypes can then be reintegrated to generate a new model that solves a new task encoded with a different prototype distribution. The fusion and adaptation performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated empirically on several real-world benchmark datasets.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of constructing black-box adversarial attacks, where no model information is revealed except for the feedback knowledge of the given inputs. To obtain sufficient knowledge for crafting adversarial examples, previous methods query the target model with inputs that are perturbed with different searching directions. However, these methods suffer from poor query efficiency since the employed searching directions are sampled randomly. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the goal of mounting efficient attacks as an optimization problem in which the adversary tries to fool the target model with a limited number of queries. Under such settings, the adversary has to select appropriate searching directions to reduce the number of model queries. By solving the efficient-attack problem, we find that we need to distill the knowledge in both the path of the adversarial examples and the path of the searching directions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, dual-path distillation, that utilizes the feedback knowledge not only to craft adversarial examples but also to alter the  searching directions to achieve efficient attacks.  Experimental results suggest that our framework can significantly increase the query efficiency.</p>

> Deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been shown very effectively. However, its performance is seriously hurt when the class distribution is mismatched, among which a common phenomenon is that unlabeled data contains the classes not seen in labeled data. Efforts on this aspect remain to be limited. This paper proposes a simple and effective safe deep SSL method to alleviate the performance harm caused by it. In theory, the result learned from the new method is never worse than learning from merely labeled data, and it is theoretically guaranteed that its generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln(n)/n})$, even faster than the convergence rate in supervised learning associated with massive parameters. In the experiment of benchmark data, unlike the existing deep SSL methods which are no longer as good as supervised learning in 40\% of unseen-class unlabeled data, the new method can still achieve performance gain in more than 60\% of unseen-class unlabeled data. The proposal is suitable for any deep SSL algorithm and can be easily extended to handle other cases of class distribution mismatch.

> <p>The translation equivariance of convolutional layers enables CNNs to generalize well on image problems. While translation equivariance provides a powerful inductive bias for images, we often additionally desire equivariance to other transformations, such as rotations, especially for non-image data. We propose a general method to construct a convolutional layer that is equivariant to transformations from any specified Lie group with a surjective exponential map. Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method, we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular momentum.</p>

> <p>Interpretability is important in text generation for guiding the generation with interpretable attributes. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE), whose mixture components could be related to some latent attributes of data. Unfortunately, straightforward variational training of GM-VAE leads the mode-collapse problem. In this paper, we find that mode-collapse is a general problem for VAEs with exponential family mixture priors.  We propose DEM-VAE, which introduces an extra dispersion term to induce a well-structured latent space. Experimental results show that our approach does obtain a well structured latent space, with which our method outperforms strong baselines in interpretable text generation benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Both relational thinking and relational reasoning lie at the core of human intelligence. While relational reasoning has inspired many perspectives in artificial intelligence, relational thinking is relatively unexplored in solving machine learning problems. It is characterized by initially relying on innumerable unconscious percepts pertaining to relations between new sensory signals and prior knowledge, consequently becoming a recognizable concept or object through coupling of these percepts. Such mental processes are difficult to model in real-world problems such as in conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR), as the percepts (e.g. unconscious mental impressions formed while hearing sounds) are supposed to be innumerable and not directly observable. And yet the dialogue history of the conversation might still reflect such underlying processes, allowing an indirect way of modeling. We present a framework that models a percept as weak relations between a current utterance and its history. We assume the probability of the existence of such a relation to be close to zero due to the unconsciousness of the percept. Given an utterance and its history, our method can generate an infinite number of probabilistic graphs representing percepts and further analytically combine them into a new graph representing strong relations among utterances. This new graph can be further transformed to be task-specific and provide an informative representation for acoustic modeling. Our approach is able to successfully infer relations among utterances without using any relational data during training. Experimental evaluations on ASR tasks including CHiME-2, SWB-30k and CHiME-5 demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our method.</p>

> <p>In this work, we propose a novel method for generating 3D point clouds that leverage properties of hyper networks. Contrary to the existing methods that learn only the representation of a 3D object, our approach simultaneously finds a representation of the object and its 3D surfaces. The main idea of our HyperCloud method is to build a hyper network that returns weights of a particular neural network (target network) trained to map points from a uniform unit ball distribution into a 3D shape. As a consequence, a particular 3D shape can be generated using point-by-point sampling from the assumed prior distribution and transforming sampled points with the target network. Since the hyper network is based on an auto-encoder architecture trained to reconstruct realistic 3D shapes, the target network weights can be considered a parametrisation of the surface of a 3D shape, and not a standard representation of point cloud usually returned by competitive approaches. The proposed architecture allows to find mesh-based representation of 3D objects in a generative manner, while providing point clouds en pair in quality with the state-of-the-art methods. </p>

> <p>In this work, we propose a robust test for the multivariate two-sample problem through projective ensemble, which is a generalization of the Cramer-von Mises statistic. The proposed test statistic has a simple closed-form expression without any tuning parameters involved, it is easy to implement can be computed in quadratic time. Moreover, our test is insensitive to the dimension and consistent against all fixed alternatives, it does not require the moment assumption and is robust to the presence of outliers. We study the asymptotic behaviors of the test statistic under the null and two kinds of alternative hypotheses. We also suggest a permutation procedure to approximate critical values and employ its consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our test through extensive simulation studies and a real data application.</p>

  Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Jeff Bilmes, Jure Leskovec [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3274-Metadata.json)
> <p>Incremental gradient (IG) methods, such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants are commonly used for large scale optimization in machine learning. Despite the sustained effort to make IG methods more data-efficient, it remains an open question how to select a training data subset that can theoretically and practically perform on par with the full dataset. Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models. Our extensive set of experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same solution, speeds up various IG methods by up to 6x for logistic regression and 3x for training deep neural networks.</p>

> <p>Sample selection approaches are popular in robust learning from noisy labels. However, how to properly control the selection process so that deep networks can benefit from the memorization effect is a hard problem. In this paper, motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), we model this issue as a function approximation problem.  Specifically, we design a domain-specific search space based on general patterns of the memorization effect and propose a novel Newton algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently.  We further provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, which ensures a good approximation to critical points. Experiments are performed on both benchmark and real-world data sets. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is much better than the state-of-the-art noisy-label-learning approaches, and also much more efficient than existing AutoML algorithms.</p>

> Randomized smoothing is the current state-of-the-art defense with provable robustness against $\ell_2$ adversarial attacks. Many works have devised new randomized smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however, substantial effort was needed to derive such new guarantees. This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing?  We propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our theoretical contributions are: (1) we show that for an appropriate notion of &quot;optimal&quot;, the optimal smoothing distributions for any &quot;nice&quot; norms have level sets given by the norm&#x27;s *Wulff Crystal*; (2) we propose two novel and complementary methods for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution; and, (3) we show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. Meanwhile, we show using (3) that with only label statistics under random input perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_p$-norm $\Omega(\min(1, d^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}))$, when the input dimension $d$ is large.

> <p>Interpretability allows the domain-expert to directly evaluate the model's relevance and reliability, a practice that offers assurance and builds trust. In the healthcare setting, interpretable models should implicate relevant biological mechanisms independent of technical factors like data pre-processing. We define personalized interpretability as a measure of sample-specific feature attribution, and view it as a minimum requirement for a precision health model to justify its conclusions. Some health data, especially those generated by high-throughput sequencing experiments, have nuances that compromise precision health models and their interpretation. These data are compositional, meaning that each feature is conditionally dependent on all other features. We propose the DeepCoDA framework to extend precision health modelling to high-dimensional compositional data, and to provide personalized interpretability through patient-specific weights. Our architecture maintains state-of-the-art performance across 25 real-world data sets, all while producing interpretations that are both personalized and fully coherent for compositional data.</p>

  Raef Bassily, Albert Cheu, Shay Moran, Aleksandar Nikolov, Jonathan Ullman, Steven Wu [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3293-Metadata.json)
> We study the problem of differentially private query release assisted by public data. Given a class $H$ of queries $h:X \rightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, and data set of i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution $D$, a query-release algorithm is required to output a data structure $G: H \rightarrow [-1, 1]$ such that for any query $h\in H,$ $G(h)$ approximates $E_{x\sim D}[h(x)]$ up to some error $\alpha$. In this problem, the input data set consists of two types of samples: private and public.  The algorithm is required to satisfy differential privacy only with respect to the private samples. We study the limits of this task in terms of private and public sample complexities. First, we show that this task is achievable for any query class of finite VC-dimension using only (roughly) $d/\alpha$ public samples and $\sqrt{p}d^{3/2}/\alpha^2$ private samples, where $d$ is the VC-dimension of the class, and $p$ is the dual VC-dimension. When there are no public samples, there are known examples of classes of VC-dimension one for which this task is impossible under differential privacy (e.g., the class of threshold functions over $R$). Moreover, our upper bound on the public sample complexity is non-trivial since, without private samples, it is known that this task is equivalent to uniform convergence over $H$ which requires at least $d/\alpha^2$ public samples. Next, we give lower bounds on private and public sample complexities with tight dependence on $p$ and $\alpha$. In particular, for the class of decision stumps, we give a lower bound of $\sqrt{p}/\alpha$ on the private sample complexity whenever the number of public samples is $&lt;1/\alpha^2$. Given our upper bound, this shows that the dependence on $\sqrt{p}$ in the private sample complexity is necessary (in the non-trivial regime where the public samples are insufficient to solve the problem on its own). We also give a tight lower bound of $1/\alpha$ on the public sample complexity for a broad family of query classes.

> <p>We present and investigate a novel application domain for deep reinforcement learning (RL): droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). A DMFB, composed of a two-dimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as high-throughput DNA sequencing and point-of-care clinical diagnosis. However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay outcome. While it is not feasible to detect the degradation of an electrode by simply examining its appearance, we show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of electrodes and to provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RL-based droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated DMFB. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet-routing problems on DMFBs.</p>

> <p>This article derives lower bounds on the convergence rate of continuous-time gradient-based optimization algorithms. The algorithms are subjected to a time-normalization constraint that avoids a reparametrization of time in order to make the discussion of continuous-time convergence rates meaningful. We reduce the multi-dimensional problem to a single dimension, recover well-known lower bounds from the discrete-time setting, and provide insights into why these lower bounds occur. We further explicitly provide algorithms that achieve the proposed lower bounds, even when the function class under consideration includes certain non-convex functions.</p>

  Jianshu Zhang, Jun Du, Yongxin Yang, Yi-Zhe Song, Si Wei, Lirong Dai [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3307-Metadata.json)
> <p>Recent encoder-decoder approaches typically employ string decoders to convert images into serialized strings for image-to-markup. However, for tree-structured representational markup, string representations can hardly cope with the structural complexity. In this work, we first show via a set of toy problems that string decoders struggle to decode tree structures, especially as structural complexity increases. We then propose a tree-structured decoder that specifically aims at generating a tree-structured markup. Our decoders works sequentially, where at each step a child node and its parent node are simultaneously generated to form a sub-tree. This sub-tree is consequently used to construct the final tree structure in a recurrent manner. Key to the success of our tree decoder is twofold, (i) it strictly respects the parent-child relationship of trees, and (ii) it explicitly outputs trees as oppose to a linear string. Evaluated on both math formula recognition and chemical formula recognition, the proposed tree decoder is shown to greatly outperform strong string decoder baselines.</p>

> Increasing the scale of reinforcement learning experiments has allowed researchers to achieve unprecedented results in both training sophisticated agents for video games, and in sim-to-real transfer for robotics. Typically such experiments rely on large distributed systems and require expensive hardware setups, limiting wider access to this exciting area of research. In this work we aim to solve this problem by optimizing the efficiency and resource utilization of reinforcement learning algorithms instead of relying on distributed computation. We present the &quot;Sample Factory&quot;, a high-throughput training system optimized for a single-machine setting. Our architecture combines a highly efficient, asynchronous, GPU-based sampler with off-policy correction techniques, allowing us to achieve throughput higher than $10^5$ environment frames/second on non-trivial control problems in 3D without sacrificing sample efficiency. We extend Sample Factory to support self-play and population-based training and apply these techniques to train highly capable agents for a multiplayer first-person shooter game.

> Learning graph generative models is a challenging task for deep learning and has wide applicability to a range of domains like chemistry, biology and social science. However current deep neural methods suffer from limited scalability: for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, existing deep neural methods require $\Omega(n^2)$ complexity by building up the  adjacency matrix. On the other hand, many real world graphs are actually sparse in the sense that $m\ll n^2$. Based on this, we develop a novel autoregressive model, named BiGG, that utilizes this sparsity to avoid generating the full adjacency matrix, and importantly reduces the graph generation time complexity to $O((n + m)\log n)$. Furthermore, during training this autoregressive model can be parallelized with $O(\log n)$ synchronization stages, which makes it much more efficient than other autoregressive models that require $\Omega(n)$. Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed approach not only scales to orders of magnitude larger graphs than previously possible with deep autoregressive graph generative models, but also yields better graph generation quality.

> <p>The goal of neural-symbolic computation is to integrate the connectionist and symbolist paradigms. Prior methods learn the neural-symbolic models using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which ignore the error propagation in the symbolic reasoning module and thus converge slowly with sparse rewards. In this paper, we address these issues and close the loop of neural-symbolic learning by (1) introducing the grammar model as a symbolic prior to bridge neural perception and symbolic reasoning, and (2) proposing a novel back-search algorithm which mimics the top-down human-like learning procedure to propagate the error through the symbolic reasoning module efficiently. We further interpret the proposed learning framework as maximum likelihood estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and the back-search algorithm as a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The experiments are conducted on two weakly-supervised neural-symbolic tasks: (1) handwritten formula recognition on the newly introduced HWF dataset; (2) visual question answering on the CLEVR dataset. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the RL methods in terms of performance, converging speed, and data efficiency.

  Tony Duan, Anand Avati, Daisy Ding, Khanh K. Thai, Sanjay Basu, Andrew Ng, Alejandro Schuler [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3337-Metadata.json)
> <p>We present Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost), an algorithm for generic probabilistic prediction via gradient boosting. Typical regression models return a point estimate, conditional on covariates, but probabilistic regression models output a full probability distribution over the outcome space, conditional on the covariates. This allows for predictive uncertainty estimation - crucial in applications like healthcare and weather forecasting. NGBoost generalizes gradient boosting to probabilistic regression by treating the parameters of the conditional distribution as targets for a multiparameter boosting algorithm. Furthermore, we show how the Natural Gradient is required to correct the training dynamics of our multiparameter boosting approach. NGBoost can be used with any base learner, any family of distributions with continuous parameters, and any scoring rule. NGBoost matches or exceeds the performance of existing methods for probabilistic prediction while offering additional benefits in flexibility, scalability, and usability. An open-source implementation is available at github.com/stanfordmlgroup/ngboost.</p>

> <p>Recently, deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a highly active research area as many real-world problems can be inherently viewed as multiagent systems. A particularly interesting and widely applicable class of problems is the partially observable cooperative multiagent setting, in which a team of agents learns to coordinate their behaviors conditioning on their private observations and commonly shared global reward signals. One natural solution is to resort to the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. During centralized training, one key challenge is the multiagent credit assignment: how to allocate the global rewards for individual agent policies for better coordination towards maximizing system-level's benefits. In this paper, we propose a new method called Q-value Path Decomposition (QPD) to decompose the system's global Q-values into individual agents' Q-values. Unlike previous works which restrict the representation relation of the individual Q-values and the global one, we leverage the integrated gradient attribution technique into deep MARL to directly decompose global Q-values along trajectory paths to assign credits for agents. We evaluate QPD on the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and show that QPD achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent scenarios compared with existing cooperative MARL algorithms.</p>

> <p>We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application of auto-encoder in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning.  This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression.  Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks with images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning agents.</p>

> <p>Designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization appears ubiquitously in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automate the design of a solver while relying less on sophisticated domain knowledge of the target problem. However, the existing DRL solvers determine the solution using a number of stages proportional to the size of the solution, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a novel DRL scheme where the agent adaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to defer the determination of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed framework, coined Learning what to Defer (LwD), to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also show that LwD can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs having millions of vertices, under a limited time budget. </p>

> <p>Decision tree optimization is notoriously difficult from a computational perspective but essential for the field of interpretable machine learning. Despite efforts over the past 40 years, only recently have optimization breakthroughs been made that have allowed practical algorithms to find optimal decision trees. These new techniques have the potential to trigger a paradigm shift, where, it is possible to construct sparse decision trees to efficiently optimize a variety of objective functions, without relying on greedy splitting and pruning heuristics that often lead to suboptimal solutions. The contribution in this work is to provide a general framework for decision tree optimization that addresses the two significant open problems in the area: treatment of imbalanced data and fully optimizing over continuous variables. We present techniques that produce optimal decision trees over variety of objectives including F-score, AUC, and partial area under the ROC convex hull. We also introduce a scalable algorithm that produces provably optimal results in the presence of continuous variables and speeds up decision tree construction by several order of magnitude relative to  the state-of-the art.</p>

> <p>We build four new test sets for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and evaluate the ability of question-answering systems to generalize to new data. In the original Wikipedia domain, we find no evidence of adaptive overfitting despite several years of test-set reuse. On datasets derived from New York Times articles, Reddit posts, and Amazon product reviews, we observe average performance drops of 3.0, 12.6, and 14.0 F1, respectively, across a broad range of models. In contrast, a strong human baseline matches or exceeds the performance of SQuAD models on the original domain and exhibits little to no drop in new domains. Taken together, our results confirm the surprising resilience of the holdout method and emphasize the need to move towards evaluation metrics that incorporate robustness to natural distribution shifts.</p>

> <p>We consider a decentralized stochastic learning problem where data points are distributed among computing nodes communicating over a directed graph. As the model size gets large, decentralized learning faces a major bottleneck that is the heavy communication load due to each node transmitting large messages (model updates) to its neighbors. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose the quantized decentralized stochastic learning algorithm over directed graphs that is based on the push-sum algorithm in decentralized consensus optimization. More importantly, we prove that our algorithm achieves the same convergence rates of the decentralized stochastic learning algorithm with exact-communication for both convex and non-convex losses. A key technical challenge of the work is to prove exact convergence of the proposed decentralized learning algorithm in the presence of quantization noise with unbounded variance over directed graphs. We provide numerical evaluations that corroborate our main theoretical results and illustrate significant speed-up compared to the exact-communication methods.</p>

> <p>Normalizing flows transform a latent distribution through an invertible neural network for a flexible and pleasingly simple approach to generative modelling, while preserving an exact likelihood. We propose FlowGMM, an end-to-end approach to generative semi supervised learning with normalizing flows, using a latent Gaussian mixture model. FlowGMM is distinct in its simplicity, unified treatment of labelled and unlabelled data with an exact likelihood, interpretability, and broad applicability beyond image data. We show promising results on a wide range of applications, including AG-News and Yahoo Answers text data, tabular data, and semi-supervised image classification. We also show that FlowGMM can discover interpretable structure, provide real-time optimization-free feature visualizations, and specify well calibrated predictive distributions.</p>

> We consider a deep ReLU / Leaky ReLU student network trained from the output of a fixed teacher network of the same depth, with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The student network is \emph{over-realized}: at each layer $l$, the number $n_l$ of student nodes is more than that ($m_l$) of teacher. Under mild conditions on dataset and teacher network, we prove that when the gradient is small at every data sample, each teacher node is \emph{specialized} by at least one student node \emph{at the lowest layer}. For two-layer network, such specialization can be achieved by training on any dataset of \emph{polynomial} size $\cO( K^{5/2} d^3 \epsilon^{-1})$ (sample size including augmentation) until the gradient magnitude drops to $\cO(\epsilon/K^{3/2}\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the input dimension, $K = m_1 + n_1$ is the total number of neurons in the lowest layer of teacher and student. To our best knowledge, we are the first to give polynomial sample complexity for student specialization of training two-layer (Leaky) ReLU networks with finite depth and width in teacher-student setting, and finite complexity for the lowest layer specialization in multi-layer case, without parametric assumption of the input (like Gaussian). Our theory suggests that teacher nodes with large fan-out weights get specialized first when the gradient is still large, while others are specialized with small gradient, which suggests inductive bias in training. This shapes the stage of training as empirically observed in multiple previous works. Experiments on synthetic and CIFAR10 verify our findings.

> <p>Given data drawn from an unknown distribution, D, to what extent is it possible to <code>amplify'' this dataset and faithfully output an even larger set of samples that appear to have been drawn from D? We formalize this question as follows: an (n,m) amplification procedure takes as input n independent draws from an unknown distribution D, and outputs a set of m &gt; n</code>samples'' which must be indistinguishable from m samples drawn iid from D. We consider this sample amplification problem in two fundamental settings: the case where D is an arbitrary discrete distribution supported on k elements, and the case where D is a d-dimensional Gaussian with unknown mean, and fixed covariance matrix. Perhaps surprisingly, we show a valid amplification procedure exists for both of these settings, even in the regime where the size of the input dataset, n, is significantly less than what would be necessary to learn distribution D to non-trivial accuracy. We also show that our procedures are optimal up to constant factors.  Beyond these results, we describe potential applications of such data amplification, and formalize a number of curious directions for future research along this vein. </p>

> <p>Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks have been shown to reveal membership information of inputs in the training data. Such membership inference attacks are a serious privacy concern, for example, patients providing medical records to build a model that detects HIV would not want their identity to be leaked. Further, we show that the attack accuracy amplifies when the model is used to predict samples that come from a different distribution than the training set, which is often the case in real world applications. Therefore, we propose the use of causal learning approaches where a model learns the causal relationship between the input features and the outcome. An ideal causal model is known to be invariant to the training distribution and hence generalizes well to shifts between samples from the same distribution and across different distributions. First, we prove that models learned using causal structure provide stronger differential privacy guarantees than associational models under reasonable assumptions. Next, we show that causal models trained on sufficiently large samples are robust to membership inference attacks across different distributions of datasets and those trained on smaller sample sizes always have lower attack accuracy than corresponding associational models. Finally, we confirm our theoretical claims with experimental evaluation on 4 datasets with moderately complex Bayesian networks and an image dataset of colored MNIST. We observe that neural network-based associational models exhibit upto 80% attack accuracy under different test distributions and sample sizes whereas causal models exhibit attack accuracy close to a random guess. Our results confirm the value of the generalizability of causal models in reducing susceptibility to privacy attacks.</p>

> Motivated by economic applications such as recommender systems, we study the behavior of  stochastic bandits algorithms under \emph{strategic behavior} conducted by rational actors, i.e.,  the arms. Each arm is a \emph{self-interested} strategic player who can modify its own reward whenever pulled, subject to a cross-period budget constraint, in order to maximize its own expected number of times of being pulled. We analyze the robustness of three popular  bandit algorithms: UCB, $\varepsilon$-Greedy, and Thompson Sampling. We prove that all three algorithms achieve a regret upper bound $\mathcal{O}(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$  where $B$ is the total budget across arms, $K$ is the total number of arms and $T$ is the running time of the algorithms.  This regret guarantee holds for \emph{arbitrary  adaptive} manipulation strategy of  arms.  Our second set of main results shows that this regret bound is \emph{tight}--- in fact, for UCB, it is tight even when we restrict the arms&#x27; manipulation strategies to form a \emph{Nash equilibrium}. We do so by characterizing the Nash equilibrium of the game induced by arms&#x27; strategic manipulations and show a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\max \{ B, K\ln T\})$ at the equilibrium.

> <p>The notion of flat minima has gained attention as a key metric of the generalization ability of deep learning models. However, current definitions of flatness are known to be sensitive to parameter rescaling. While some previous studies have proposed to rescale flatness metrics using parameter scales to avoid the scale dependence, the normalized metrics lose the direct theoretical connections between flat minima and generalization. In this paper, we first provide generalization error bounds using existing normalized flatness measures. Using the analysis, we then propose a novel normalized flatness metric. The proposed metric enjoys both direct theoretical connections and better empirical correlation to generalization error.</p>

  Edric Tam, David Dunson [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3408-Metadata.json)
> <p>We introduce a novel regularization approach for deep learning that incorporates and respects the underlying graphical structure of the neural network. Existing regularization methods often focus on dropping/penalizing weights in a global manner that ignores the connectivity structures of the neural network. We propose to use the Fiedler value of the neural network's underlying graph as a tool for regularization. We provide theoretical support for this approach via Spectral Graph Theory. We demonstrate the convexity of this penalty and provide an approximate, variational approach for fast computation in practical training of neural networks. We provide bounds on such approximations. We provide an alternative but equivalent formulation of this framework in the form of a structurally weighted L1 penalty, thus linking our approach to sparsity induction. We trained neural networks on various datasets to compare Fiedler Regularization with traditional regularization methods such as Dropout and weight decay. Results demonstrate the efficacy of Fiedler Regularization.</p>

> We consider a variant of the classical online linear optimization problem in which at every step, the online player receives a ``hint&#x27;&#x27; vector before choosing the action for that round. Rather surprisingly, it was shown that if the hint vector is guaranteed to have a positive correlation with the cost vector, then the online player can achieve a regret of $O(\log T)$, thus significantly improving over the $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the general setting. However, the result and analysis require the correlation property at \emph{all} time steps, thus raising the natural question: can we design online learning algorithms that are resilient to bad hints?   In this paper we develop algorithms and nearly matching lower bounds for online learning with imperfect hints.  Our algorithms are oblivious to the quality of the hints, and the regret bounds interpolate between the always-correlated hints case and the no-hints case.  Our results also generalize, simplify, and improve upon previous results on optimistic regret bounds, which can be viewed as an additive version of hints.

> <p>To analyze high-dimensional and complex data in the real world, generative model approach of machine learning aims to reduce the dimension and acquire a probabilistic model of the data. For this purpose, deep-autoencoder based generative models such as variational autoencoder (VAE) have been proposed. However, in previous works, the scale of metrics between the real and the reduced-dimensional space (latent space) is not well-controlled. Therefore, the quantitative impact of the latent variable on real data is unclear. In the end, the probability distribution function (PDF) in the real space cannot be estimated from that of the latent space accurately. To overcome this problem, we propose Rate-Distortion Optimization guided autoencoder. We show our method has the following properties theoretically and experimentally: (i) the columns of Jacobian matrix between two spaces is constantly-scaled orthonormal system and data can be embedded in a Euclidean space isometrically; (ii) the PDF of the latent space is proportional to that of the real space.  Furthermore, to verify the usefulness in the practical application, we evaluate its performance in unsupervised anomaly detection and it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

  Wei Chen, Xiaoming Sun, Jialin Zhang, Zhijie Zhang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3418-Metadata.json)
> We revisit the optimization from samples (OPS) model, which studies the problem of optimizing objective functions directly from the sample data. Previous results showed that we cannot obtain a constant approximation ratio for the maximum coverage problem using polynomially many independent samples of the form $\{S_i, f(S_i)\}_{i=1}^t$ (Balkanski et al., 2017), even if coverage functions are $(1 - \epsilon)$-PMAC learnable using these samples (Badanidiyuru et al., 2012), which means most of the function values can be approximately learned very well with high probability. In this work, to circumvent the impossibility result of OPS, we propose a stronger model called optimization from structured samples (OPSS) for coverage functions, where the data samples encode the structural information of the functions. We show that under three general assumptions on the sample distributions, we can design efficient OPSS algorithms that achieve a constant approximation for the maximum coverage problem. We further prove a constant lower bound under these assumptions, which is tight when not considering computational efficiency. Moreover, we also show that if we remove any one of the three assumptions, OPSS for the maximum coverage problem has no constant approximation.

> <p>We provide an exact asymptotic analysis of the performance of some fast randomized algorithms for solving overdetermined least-squares problems. We consider first-order methods, where the gradients are pre-conditioned by an approximation of the Hessian, based itself on a subspace embedding of the data matrix. This class of algorithms encompasses several randomized methods among the fastest solvers for least-squares problems. We focus on two classical embeddings, namely, Gaussian projections and subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHT). Our key technical innovation is the derivation of the limiting spectral density of SRHT embeddings. Leveraging this novel result, we derive the family of normalized orthogonal polynomials of the SRHT density and we find the optimal pre-conditioned first-order method and its rate of convergence. Our analysis of Gaussian embeddings proceeds similarly, and leverages classical random matrix theory results. In particular, we show that for a given sketch size, SRHT embeddings exhibits a faster rate of convergence than Gaussian embeddings. Then, we propose a new algorithm by optimizing the computational complexity over the choice of the sketching dimension. To our knowledge, our resulting algorithm yields the best known complexity for solving least-squares problems.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we study a family of non-convex and possibly non-smooth inf-projection minimization problems, where the target objective function is equal to minimization of a joint function over another variable. This problem include difference of convex (DC) functions and a family of bi-convex functions as special cases. We develop stochastic algorithms and establish their first-order convergence for finding a (nearly) stationary solution of the target non-convex function under different conditions of the component functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively studies stochastic optimization of non-convex inf-projection minimization problems with provable convergence guarantee. Our algorithms enable efficient stochastic optimization of a family of non-decomposable DC functions and a family of bi-convex functions. To demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithms we consider an important application in variance-based regularization, and experiments verify the effectiveness of our inf-projection based formulation and the proposed stochastic algorithm in comparison with previous stochastic algorithms based on the min-max formulation for achieving the same effect.</p>

> <p>Invariance (defined in a general sense) has been one of the most effective priors for representation learning.  Direct factorization of parametric models is feasible only for a small range of invariances, while regularization approaches, despite improved generality, lead to nonconvex optimization.  In this work, we develop a \emph{convex} representation learning algorithm for a variety of generalized invariances that can be modeled as semi-norms.  Novel Euclidean embeddings are introduced for kernel representers in a semi-inner-product space, and approximation bounds are established.  This allows invariant representations to be learned efficiently and effectively as confirmed in our experiments, along with accurate predictions.</p>

> <p>We investigate the connections between neural networks and simple building blocks in kernel space. In particular, using well established feature space tools such as direct sum, averaging, and moment lifting, we present an algebra for creating âcompositionalâ kernels from bags of features. We show that these operations correspond to many of the building blocks of âneural tangent kernels (NTK)â. Experimentally, we show that there is a correlation in test error between neural network architectures and the associated kernels. We construct a simple neural network architecture using only 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 average pooling, ReLU, and optimized with SGD and MSE loss that achieves 96% accuracy on CIFAR10, and whose corresponding compositional kernel achieves 90% accuracy. We also use our constructions to investigate the relative performance of neural networks, NTKs, and compositional kernels in the small dataset regime. In particular, we find that compositional kernels outperform NTKs and neural networks outperform both kernel methods.</p>

> <p>Recent successes of game-theoretic formulations in ML have caused a resurgence of research interest in differentiable games. Overwhelmingly, that research focuses on methods and upper bounds. In this work, we approach the question of fundamental iteration complexity by providing lower bounds to complement the linear (i.e. geometric) upper bounds observed in the literature on a wide class of problems. We cast saddle-point and min-max problems as 2-player games. We leverage tools from single-objective convex optimisation to propose new linear lower bounds for convex-concave games. Notably, we give a linear lower bound for n-player differentiable games, by using the spectral properties of the update operator. We then propose a new definition of the condition number arising from our lower bound analysis. Unlike past definitions, our condition number captures the fact that linear rates are possible in games, even in the absence of strong convex-concavity.</p>

> In this paper, we consider multi-agent learning via online gradient descent in a class of games called $\lambda$-cocoercive games, a fairly broad class of games that admits many Nash equilibria and that properly includes unconstrained strongly monotone games. We characterize the finite-time last-iterate convergence rate for joint OGD learning on $\lambda$-cocoercive games; further, building on this result, we develop a fully adaptive OGD learning algorithm that does not require any knowledge of problem parameter (e.g. cocoercive constant $\lambda$) and show, via a novel double-stopping time technique, that this adaptive algorithm achieves same finite-time last-iterate convergence rate as non-adaptive counterpart. Subsequently, we extend OGD learning to the noisy gradient feedback case and establish last-iterate convergence results--first qualitative almost sure convergence, then quantitative finite-time convergence rates-- all under non-decreasing step-sizes. To our knowledge, we provide the first set of results that fill in several gaps of the existing multi-agent online learning literature, where three aspects--finite-time convergence rates, non-decreasing step-sizes, and fully adaptive algorithms have been unexplored before.

> <p>In this paper, we study the leading eigenvector problem in a statistically distributed setting and propose a communication-efficient algorithm based on Riemannian optimization, which trades local computation for global communication. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm linearly converges to the centralized empirical risk minimization solution regarding the number of communication rounds. When the number of data points in local machines is sufficiently large, the proposed algorithm achieves a significant reduction of communication cost over existing distributed PCA algorithms. Superior performance in terms of communication cost of the proposed algorithm is verified on real-world and synthetic datasets.</p>

> The expensive inter-machine communication is the bottleneck of distributed optimization. Existing study tackles this problem by shortening the communication rounds, but the reduction of per-round communication cost is not well-studied. This work proposes a progressive manifold identification approach with  sound theoretical justifications to greatly reduce both the communication rounds and the bytes communicated per round for partly smooth regularized problems, which include many large-scale machine learning tasks such as the training of $\ell_1$- and group-LASSO-regularized models. Our method uses an inexact proximal quasi-Newton method to iteratively identify a sequence of low-dimensional smooth manifolds in which the final solution lies, and restricts the model update within the current manifold to lower significantly the per-round communication cost. After identifying the final manifold within which the problem is smooth, we take superlinear-convergent truncated semismooth Newton steps obtained through preconditioned conjugate gradient to largely reduce the communication rounds. Experiments show that when compared with the state of the art, the communication cost of our method is significantly lower and the running time is up to $10$ times faster.

> We consider a single-product dynamic pricing problem under a specific non-stationary setting, where the demand grows over time in expectation and possibly gets noisier. The decision maker dynamically sets price and learns the unknown price elasticity, with the goal of maximizing expected cumulative revenue. We prove matching upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal pricing policies. We show how the change in demand uncertainty over time affects the optimal policy design and demonstrate how the order of optimal regret depends on the magnitude of demand uncertainty evolvement. Moreover, we distinguish between the \textit{any-time} situation and the \textit{fixed-time} situation by whether the seller knows the total number of time periods $T$ in advance or not, and show that they surprisingly render different optimal regret orders. We then extend the demand model to a more general case allowing for an additional intercept term and present a novel and near-optimal algorithm for the extended model. Finally, we consider an analogous non-stationary setting in the canonical multi-armed bandit problem, and points out that the \textit{any-time} situation and the \textit{fixed-time} situation render the same optimal regret order in a simple form, in contrast to the dynamic pricing problem.

> <p>Neural networks utilize the softmax as a building block in classification tasks, which contains an overconfidence problem and lacks an uncertainty representation ability. As a Bayesian alternative to the softmax, we consider a random variable of a categorical probability over class labels. In this framework, the prior distribution explicitly models the presumed noise inherent in the observed label, which provides consistent gains in generalization performance in multiple challenging tasks. The proposed method inherits advantages of Bayesian approaches that achieve better uncertainty estimation and model calibration. Our method can be implemented as a plug-and-play loss function with negligible computational overhead compared to the softmax with the cross-entropy loss function.</p>

> <p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) enjoys several benefits, such as data-efficiency and planning, by learning a model of the environment's dynamics. However, learning a global model that can generalize across different dynamics remains a challenge. To tackle this problem, we decompose the task of learning a global dynamics model into two stages: (a) learning a context latent vector that captures the local dynamics, then (b) predicting the next state conditioned on it. In order to encode dynamics-specific information into the context latent vector, we introduce a novel loss function that encourages the context latent vector to be useful for predicting both forward and backward dynamics. The proposed method achieves superior generalization ability across various simulated robotics and control tasks, compared to existing RL schemes.</p>

> <p>Attempts to render deep learning models interpretable, data-efficient, and robust has seen some success through hybridisation with rule-based systems like Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs). These neuro-symbolic reasoning models can induce interpretable rules and learn representations from data via back-propagation, while providing logical explanations for their predictions.  However, they are restricted by their computational complexity, as they need to consider all possible proof paths for explaining a goal, thus rendering them unfit for large-scale applications. We present Conditional Theorem Provers (CTPs), an extension to NTPs that learns an optimal rule selection strategy via gradient-based optimisation.  We show that CTPs are scalable and yield state-of-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which tests systematic generalisation of neural models. CTPs generalise better than a wide range of baselines when tested on larger graphs than trained on, while producing competitive results on standard link prediction benchmarks.</p>

> The problem of maximizing nonnegative monotone submodular functions under a certain constraint has been intensively studied in the last decade, and a wide range of efficient approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem. Many machine learning problems, including data summarization and influence maximization, can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions. However, when such applications involve sensitive data about individuals, their privacy concerns should be addressed. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions subject to matroid constraints in the framework of differential privacy. We provide $(1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}})$-approximation algorithm which improves upon the previous results in terms of approximation guarantee. This is done with an almost cubic number of function evaluations in our algorithm.  Moreover, we study $k$-submodularity, a natural generalization of submodularity. We give the first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that preserves differential privacy for maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions subject to matroid constraints. The approximation ratio is asymptotically tight and is obtained with an almost linear number of function evaluations.

> Factorizing tensors has recently become an important optimization module in a number of machine learning pipelines, especially in latent variable models. We show how to do this efficiently in the streaming setting. Given a set of $n$ vectors, each in $\~R^d$, we present algorithms to select a sublinear number of these vectors as coreset, while guaranteeing that the CP decomposition of the $p$-moment tensor of the coreset approximates the corresponding decomposition of the $p$-moment tensor computed from the full data. We introduce two novel algorithmic techniques: online filtering and kernelization. Using these two, we   present four algorithms that achieve different tradeoffs of coreset size, update time and working space, beating or matching various state of the art algorithms. In case of matrices (2-ordered tensor) our online row sampling algorithm guarantees $(1 \pm \epsilon)$ relative error spectral approximation. We show applications of our algorithms in learning single topic modeling.

> <p>During the past five years the Bayesian deep learning community has developed increasingly accurate and efficient approximate inference procedures that allow for Bayesian inference in deep neural networks.  However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice.  In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions when compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a ``cold posterior'' that overcounts evidence.  Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers.  We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments.  Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations?  Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of cold posteriors.</p>

> <p>Optimally solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes under either full or no information sharing received significant attention in recent years. However, little is known about how partial information sharing affects existing theory and algorithms. This paper addresses this question for a team of two agents, with one-sided information sharing---\ie both agents have imperfect information about the state of the world, but only one has access to what the other sees and does. From the perspective of a central planner, we show that the original problem can be reformulated into an equivalent information-state Markov decision process and solved as such. Besides, we prove that the optimal value function exhibits a specific form of uniform continuity. We also present a heuristic search algorithm utilizing this property and providing the first results for this family of problems.</p>

> <p>Efficient numerical solvers for sparse linear systems are crucial in science and engineering. One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse linear systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the construction of AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operator---a problem-dependent sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the solver and is critical to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function.  Experiments on a broad class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG, demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system solvers.</p>

> We propose a novel stochastic network model, called Fractal Gaussian Network (FGN), that embodies well-defined and analytically tractable fractal structures. Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse applications. FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random geometric graphs (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with increasingly fractal behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse random geometric graphs that are parametrised by a fractality parameter $\nu$ which governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of fractality in its own right. We explore the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data. Finally, we explore fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block model in the setting of FGNs.

  Youngsuk Park, Ryan Rossi, Zheng Wen, Gang Wu, Handong Zhao [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3607-Metadata.json)
> <p>Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is one of the most popular frameworks to tackle continuous Markov decision process tasks. With its fundamental theory and tractable optimal policy, LQR has been revisited and analyzed in recent years, in terms of reinforcement learning scenarios such as the model-free or model-based setting. In this paper, we introduce the Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) for LQR, a method capable of deriving a structured linear policy. Such a structured policy with (block) sparsity or low-rank can have significant advantages over the standard LQR policy: more interpretable, memory-efficient, and well-suited for the distributed setting. In order to derive such a policy, we first cast a regularized LQR problem when the model is known. Then, our Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) algorithm, which takes a policy evaluation step and a policy improvement step in an iterative manner, can solve this regularized LQR efficiently. We further extend the S-PI algorithm to the model-free setting where a smoothing procedure is adopted to estimate the gradient. In both the known-model and model-free setting, we prove convergence analysis under the proper choice of parameters. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the advantages of S-PI in terms of balancing the LQR performance and level of structure by varying the weight parameter.</p>

> <p>Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) enable generating realistic images, which can be possibly misused. Detecting GAN-generated images (GAN-images) become more challenging because of the significant reduction of underlying artifacts and specific patterns. The absence of such traces can hinder detection algorithms to detect GAN-images and transfer knowledge in detecting other types of GAN-images. In this work, we present a robust transferable framework to effectively detect GAN-images, called Transferable GAN-images Detection framework (T-GD). T-GD is composed of a teacher and a student model, which can both iteratively teach and evaluate each other to improve the detection performance. First, we train the teacher model on the source dataset and use it as a starting point for learning the target dataset. For training the student model, we inject noise by mixing up both the source and target dataset, but constrain the weights variation for preserving the starting point. Our approach is a self-training method, but is different from prior approaches by focusing on improving the transferability over GAN-images detection. T-GD achieves a high performance on source dataset, overcoming catastrophic forgetting as well as effectively detecting state-of-the-art GAN-images with only a small volume of data without any metadata information.</p>

> <p>Stochastic neural networks with discrete random variables are an important class of models for their expressiveness and interpretability. Since direct differentiation and backpropagation is not possible, Monte Carlo gradient estimation techniques are a popular alternative. Efficient stochastic gradient estimators, such Straight-Through and Gumbel-Softmax, work well for shallow stochastic models. Their performance, however, suffers with hierarchical, more complex models. We focus on hierarchical stochastic networks with multiple layers of Boolean latent variables. To analyze such networks, we introduce the framework of harmonic analysis for Boolean functions to derive an analytic formulation for the bias and variance in the Straight-Through estimator. Exploiting these formulations, we propose \emph{FouST}, a low-bias and low-variance gradient estimation algorithm that is just as efficient. Extensive experiments show that FouST performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art biased estimators and is much faster than unbiased ones.</p>

> <p>Measuring the similarity between data points often requires domain knowledge, which can in parts be compensated by relying on unsupervised methods such as latent-variable models, where similarity/distance is estimated in a more compact latent space. Prevalent is the use of the Euclidean metric, which has the drawback of ignoring information about similarity of data stored in the decoder, as captured by the framework of Riemannian geometry. We propose an extension to the framework of variational auto-encoders allows learning flat latent manifolds, where the Euclidean metric is a proxy for the similarity between data points. This is achieved by defining the latent space as a Riemannian manifold and by regularising the metric tensor to be a scaled identity matrix. Additionally, we replace the compact prior typically used in variational auto-encoders with a recently presented, more expressive hierarchical one---and formulate the learning problem as a constrained optimisation problem. We evaluate our method on a range of data-sets, including a video-tracking benchmark, where the performance of our unsupervised approach nears that of state-of-the-art supervised approaches, while retaining the computational efficiency of straight-line-based approaches.</p>

> <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a well established learning paradigm for jointly learning models for multiple correlated tasks. Often the tasks conflict requiring trade-offs between them during optimization. Recent advances in multi-objective optimization based MTL  have enabled us to use large-scale deep networks to find one or more Pareto optimal solutions. However, they cannot be used to find exact Pareto optimal solutions satisfying user-specified preferences with respect to task-specific losses, that is not only a common requirement in applications but also a useful way to explore the infinite set of Pareto optimal solutions. We develop the first gradient-based multi-objective MTL algorithm to address this problem. Our unique approach combines multiple gradient descent with carefully controlled ascent, that enables it to trace the Pareto front in a principled manner and makes it robust to initialization. Assuming only differentiability of the task-specific loss functions, we provide theoretical guarantees for convergence. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> <p>Current transfer learning methods are mainly based on finetuning a pretrained model with target-domain data. Motivated by the techniques from adversarial machine learning (ML) that are capable of manipulating the model prediction via data perturbations, in this paper we propose a novel approach, black-box adversarial reprogramming (BAR), that repurposes a well-trained black-box ML model (e.g., a prediction API or a proprietary software) for solving different ML tasks, especially in the scenario with scarce data and constrained resources. The rationale lies in exploiting high-performance but unknown ML models to gain learning capability for transfer learning. Using zeroth order optimization and multi-label mapping techniques, BAR can reprogram a black-box ML model solely based on its input-output responses without knowing the model architecture or changing any parameter. More importantly, in the limited medical data setting, on autism spectrum disorder classification, diabetic retinopathy detection, and melanoma detection tasks, BAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields comparable performance to the vanilla adversarial reprogramming method requiring complete knowledge of the target ML model. BAR also outperforms baseline transfer learning approaches by a significant margin, demonstrating cost-effective means and new insights for transfer learning.</p>

> We study the effect of norm based regularization on the size of coresets for the regularized regression problems. Specifically, given a matrix $ \mathbf{A} \in {\mathbf{R}}^{n \M{x}d}$ with $n\gg d$ and a vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbf{R} ^ n $ and $\lambda &gt; 0$, we analyze the size of coresets for regularized versions of regression of the form $||\M{Ax}-\M{b}||_p^r + \lambda||{\M{x}}||_q^s$ . It has been shown for the case of ridge regression ($p,q,r,s=2$) that we can obtain a coreset smaller than the coreset for its unregularized counterpart i.e. least squares regression\cite{avron2017sharper}. However we show that when $r \neq s$, no coreset for some regularized regression can have size smaller than the optimal coreset of the unregularized version. The well known LASSO problem falls under this category and hence does not allow a coreset smaller than the one for least squares regression. We propose a modified version of the LASSO problem and obtain for it a coreset of size smaller than the least square regression. We empirically show that the modified version of LASSO also induces sparsity in solution like the LASSO. We also obtain smaller coresets for $\ell_p$-regression with $\ell_p$-regularization. We extend our methods to multi response regularized regression. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the coreset performance for the modified LASSO and the $\ell_1$-regression with $\ell_1$- regularization.

> We consider the product of determinantal point processes (DPPs), a point process whose probability mass is proportional to the product of principal minors of multiple matrices as a natural, promising generalization of DPPs. We study the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which is among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks. Our complexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efficient algorithms for this task, unless input matrices are forced to have favorable structures. In particular, we prove the following: (1) Computing $\sum_{S} \det(\mat{A}_{S,S})^p$ exactly for every (fixed) positive even integer $p$ is UP-hard and Mod3P-hard, which gives a negative answer to an open question posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012). (2) $\sum_{S} \det(\mat{A}_{S,S}) \det(\mat{B}_{S,S}) \det(\mat{C}_{S,S})$ is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $ 2^{O(|I|^{1-\epsilon})} $ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, where $|I|$ is the input size. This result is stronger than #P-hardness for the case of two matrices by Gillenwater (2014). (3) There exists a $ k^{O(k)} |I|^{O(1)} $-time algorithm for computing $\sum_{S} \det(\mat{A}_{S,S}) \det(\mat{B}_{S,S})$, where $k$ is ``the maximum rank of $\mat{A}$ and $\mat{B}$&#x27;&#x27; or ``the treewidth of the graph formed by non-zero entries of $\mat{A}$ and $\mat{B}$.&#x27;&#x27; Such parameterized algorithms are said to be fixed-parameter tractable.

> <p>The combination of Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning has led to groundbreaking results in  artificial intelligence. However, AlphaZero, the current state-of-the-art MCTS algorithm still relies on handcrafted  heuristics that are only partially understood. In this paper, we show that AlphaZero's search heuristic, along with other common ones, can be interpreted as an approximation to the solution of a specific regularized policy optimization problem. With this insight, we propose a variant of AlphaZero which uses the exact solution to this policy optimization problem, and show experimentally that it reliably outperforms the original algorithm in multiple domains.</p>

> <p>We compare the model-free reinforcement learning with the model-based approaches through the lens of the expressive power of neural networks for policies, Q-functions, and dynamics. We show, theoretically and empirically, that even for one-dimensional continuous state space, there are many MDPs whose optimal Q-functions and policies are much more complex than the dynamics. For these MDPs, model-based planning is a favorable algorithm, because the resulting policies can approximate the optimal policy significantly better than a neural network parameterization can, and model-free or model-based policy optimization rely on policy parameterization. Motivated by the theory, we apply a simple multi-step model-based bootstrapping planner (BOOTS) to bootstrap a weak Q-function into a stronger policy. Empirical results show that applying BOOTS on top of model-based or model-free policy optimization algorithms at the test time improves the performance on benchmark tasks.</p>

> <p>Variational Bayesian Inference is a popular methodology for approximating posterior distributions over Bayesian neural network weights. Recent work developing this class of methods has explored ever richer parameterizations of the approximate posterior in the hope of improving performance. In contrast, here we share a curious experimental finding that suggests instead restricting the variational distribution to a more compact parameterization. For a variety of deep Bayesian neural networks trained using Gaussian mean-field variational inference, we find that the posterior standard deviations consistently exhibit strong low-rank structure after convergence. This means that by decomposing these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization, we can make our variational approximation more compact without decreasing the models' performance. Furthermore, we find that such factorized parameterizations improve the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the variational lower bound, resulting in faster convergence.</p>

> <p>Computing equilibrium states for many-body systems, such as molecules, is a long-standing challenge. In the absence of methods for generating statistically independent samples, great computational effort is invested in simulating these systems using, for example, Markov chain Monte Carlo. We present a probabilistic model that generates such samples for molecules from their graph representations. Our model learns a low-dimensional manifold that preserves the geometry of local atomic neighborhoods through a principled learning representation that is based on Euclidean distance geometry. In a new benchmark for molecular conformation generation, we show experimentally that our generative model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Finally, we show how to use our model as a proposal distribution in an importance sampling scheme to compute molecular properties.</p>

  Laurence Aitchison [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3680-Metadata.json)
> <p>Recent work has argued that neural networks can be understood theoretically by taking the number of channels to infinity, at which point the outputs become Gaussian process (GP) distributed. However, we note that infinite Bayesian neural networks lack a key facet of the behaviour of real neural networks: the fixed kernel, determined only by network hyperparameters, implies that they cannot do any form of representation learning. The lack of representation or equivalently kernel learning leads to less flexibility and hence worse performance, giving a potential explanation for the inferior performance of infinite networks observed in the literature (e.g. Novak et al. 2019). We give analytic results characterising the prior over representations and representation learning in finite deep linear networks. We show empirically that the representations in SOTA architectures such as ResNets trained with SGD are much closer to those suggested by our deep linear results than by the corresponding infinite network. This motivates the introduction of a new class of network: infinite networks with bottlenecks, which inherit the theoretical tractability of infinite networks while at the same time allowing representation learning.</p>

> <p>Human observers can learn to recognize new categories of images from a handful of examples, yet doing so with machine perception remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that data-efficient recognition is enabled by representations which make the variability in natural signals more predictable. We therefore revisit and improve Contrastive Predictive Coding, an unsupervised objective for learning such representations. This new implementation produces features which support state-of-the-art linear classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. When used as input for non-linear classification with deep neural networks, this representation allows us to use 2-5x less labels than classifiers trained directly on image pixels. Finally, this unsupervised representation substantially improves transfer learning to object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, surpassing fully supervised pre-trained ImageNet classifiers. </p>

> <p>Imitation learning in a high-dimensional environment is challenging. Most inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods fail to outperform the demonstrator in such a high-dimensional environment, e.g., Atari domain. To address this challenge, we propose a novel reward learning module to generate intrinsic reward signals via a generative model. Our generative method can perform better forward state transition and backward action encoding, which improves the module's dynamics modeling ability in the environment. Thus, our module provides the imitation agent both the intrinsic intention of the demonstrator and a better exploration ability, which is critical for the agent to outperform the demonstrator. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art IRL methods on multiple Atari games, even with one-life demonstration. Remarkably, our method achieves performance that is up to 5 times the performance of the demonstration.</p>

> <p>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet) that uses neural nets to produce \textit{good} representations to be used as inputs to an off-policy RL algorithm. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually thought to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger feature propagation together with larger networks allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves much higher sample efficiency and better performance.</p>

> <p>We consider the batch reinforcement learning problem where the agent needs to learn only from a fixed batch of data, without further interaction with the environment. In such a scenario, we want to prevent the optimized policy from deviating too much from the data collection policy since the estimation becomes highly unstable otherwise due to the off-policy nature of the problem. However, imposing this requirement too strongly will result in a policy that merely follows the data collection policy. Unlike prior work where this trade-off is controlled by hand-tuned hyperparameters, we propose a novel batch reinforcement learning approach, batch optimization of policy and hyperparameter (BOPAH), that uses a gradient-based optimization of the hyperparameter using held-out data. We show that BOPAH outperforms other batch reinforcement learning algorithms in tabular and continuous control tasks, by finding a good balance to the trade-off between adhering to the data collection policy and pursuing the possible policy improvement.</p>

> <p>Many AI problems, in robotics and other domains, are goal-directed, essentially seeking a trajectory leading to some goal state. Reinforcement learning (RL), building on Bellman's optimality equation, naturally optimizes for a single goal, yet can be made goal-directed by augmenting the state with the goal. Instead, we propose a new RL framework, derived from a dynamic programming equation for the all pairs shortest path (APSP) problem, which naturally solves goal-directed queries. We show that this approach has computational benefits for both standard and approximate dynamic programming. Interestingly, our formulation prescribes a novel protocol for computing a trajectory: instead of predicting the next state given its predecessor, as in standard RL, a goal-conditioned trajectory is constructed by first predicting an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the trajectory into two. Then, recursively, predicting intermediate points on each sub-segment, until a complete trajectory is obtained. We call this trajectory structure a sub-goal tree. Building on it, we additionally extend the policy gradient methodology to recursively predict sub-goals, resulting in novel goal-based algorithms. Finally, we apply our method to neural motion planning, where we demonstrate significant improvements compared to standard RL on navigating a 7-DoF robot arm between obstacles.</p>

> <p>Archetypal analysis (AA) aims to extract patterns using self-expressive decomposition of data as convex combinations of extremal points (on the convex hull) of the data. This work presents a computationally efficient greedy AA (GAA) algorithm. GAA leverages the underlying geometry and sparseness property of AA, is scalable to larger datasets, and has significantly faster convergence to existing methods. To achieve this, archetypes are learned via sparse projection of data in linearly transformed space. GAA employs an iterative subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is significantly faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classification, data visualization/categorization.</p>

> Tokenization is the first step of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks and plays an important role for neural NLP models. Tokenizaton method such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), which can greatly reduce the large vocabulary and deal with out-of-vocabulary words, has shown to be effective and is widely adopted for sequence generation tasks. While various tokenization methods exist, there is no common acknowledgement which is the best. In this work, we propose to leverage the mixed representations from different tokenization methods for sequence generation tasks, in order to boost the model performance with unique characteristics and advantages of individual tokenization methods. Specifically, we introduce a new model architecture to incorporate mixed representations and a co-teaching algorithm to better utilize the diversity of different tokenization methods. Our approach  achieves significant improvements on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks with six language pairs (e.g., English$\leftrightarrow$German, English$\leftrightarrow$Romanian), as well as an abstractive summarization task.

> <p>Atari games have been a long-standing benchmark in the reinforcement learning (RL) community for the past decade. This benchmark was proposed to test general competency of RL algorithms. Previous work has achieved good average performance by doing outstandingly well on many games of the set, but very poorly in several of the most challenging games. We propose Agent57, the first deep RL agent that outperforms the standard human benchmark on all 57 Atari games. To achieve this result, we train a neural network which parameterizes a family of policies ranging from very exploratory to purely exploitative. We propose an adaptive mechanism to choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process. Additionally, we utilize a novel parameterization of the architecture that allows for more consistent and stable learning.</p>

> <p>Fine-tuning the deep convolution neural network (CNN) using a pre-trained model helps transfer knowledge learned from larger datasets to the target task. While the accuracy could be largely improved even when the training dataset is small, the transfer learning outcome is similar with the pre-trained one with closed CNN weights[17], as the backpropagation here brings less updates to deeper CNN layers. In this work, we propose RIFLE - a simple yet effective strategy that deepens backpropagation in transfer learning settings, through periodically ReInitializing the Fully-connected LayEr with random scratch during the fine-tuning procedure. RIFLE brings significant perturbation to the backpropagation process and leads to deep CNN weights update, while the affects of perturbation can be easily converged throughout the overall learning procedure. The experiments show that the use of RIFLE significantly improves deep transfer learning accuracy on a wide range of datasets. It outperforms known tricks for the similar purpose, such as dropout, dropconnect, stochastic depth, and cyclic learning rate, under the same settings with 0.5%-2% higher testing accuracy. Empirical cases and ablation studies further indicate RIFLE brings meaningful updates to deep CNN layers with accuracy improved.</p>

> Explanation methods promise to make black-box classifiers more transparent. As a result, it is hoped that they can act as proof for a sensible, fair and trustworthy decision-making process of the algorithm and thereby increase its acceptance by the end-users. In this paper, we show both theoretically and experimentally that these hopes are presently unfounded. Specifically, we show that, for any classifier $g$, one can always construct another classifier $\tilde{g}$ which has the same behavior on the data (same train, validation, and test error) but has arbitrarily manipulated explanation maps. We derive this statement theoretically using differential geometry and demonstrate it experimentally for various explanation methods, architectures, and datasets. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we then propose a modification of existing explanation methods which makes them significantly more robust.

> <p>Typical architectures of Generative Adversarial Networks make use of a unimodal latent/input distribution transformed by a continuous generator. Consequently, the modeled distribution always has connected support which is cumbersome when learning a disconnected set of manifolds. We formalize this problem by establishing a "no free lunch" theorem for the disconnected manifold learning stating an upper-bound on the precision of the targeted distribution. This is done by building on the necessary existence of a low-quality region where the generator continuously samples data between two disconnected modes.  Finally, we derive a rejection sampling method based on the norm of generatorâs Jacobian and show its efficiency on several generators including BigGAN.</p>

> The input to the \emph{sets-$k$-means} problem is an integer $k\geq 1$ and a set $\mathcal{P}=\br{P_1,\cdots,P_n}$ of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The goal is to compute a set $C$ of $k$ centers (points) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that minimizes the sum $\sum_{P\in \mathcal{P}} \min_{p\in P, c\in C}\left\| p-c \right\|^2$ of squared distances to these sets. An  \emph{$\eps$-core-set} for this problem is a weighted subset of $\mathcal{P}$ that approximates this sum up to $1\pm\varepsilon$ factor, for \emph{every} set $C$ of $k$ centers in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that such a core-set of $O(\log^2{n})$ sets always exists, and can be computed in $O(n\log{n})$ time, for every input $\mathcal{P}$ and every fixed $d,k\geq 1$ and $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. The result easily generalized for any metric space, distances to the power of $z&gt;0$, and M-estimators that handle outliers. Applying an inefficient but optimal algorithm on this coreset allows us to obtain the first PTAS ($1+\eps$ approximation) for the sets-$k$-means problem that takes time near linear in $n$. This is the first result even for sets-mean on the plane ($k=1$, $d=2$).  Open source code and experimental results for document classification and facility locations are also provided.

> <p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) represent the given data in a low-dimensional latent space, which is generally assumed to be Euclidean. This assumption naturally leads to the common choice of a standard Gaussian prior over continuous latent variables. Recent work has, however, shown that this prior has a detrimental effect on model capacity, leading to subpar performance. We propose that the Euclidean assumption lies at the heart of this failure mode. To counter this, we assume a Riemannian structure over the latent space, which constitutes a more principled geometric view of the latent codes, and replace the standard Gaussian prior with a Riemannian Brownian motion prior. We propose an efficient inference scheme that does not rely on the unknown normalizing factor of this prior. Finally, we demonstrate that this prior significantly increases model capacity using only one additional scalar parameter.</p>

> <p>We describe a framework for constructing non-separable non-stationary random fields that is based on an infinite mixture of convolved stochastic processes. When the mixing process is stationary and the convolution function is non-stationary we arrive at expressive kernels that are available in closed form. When the mixing is non-stationary and the convolution function is stationary the resulting random fields exhibit varying degrees of non-separability that better preserve local structure. These kernels have natural interpretations through corresponding stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and are demonstrated on a range of synthetic benchmarks and spatio-temporal applications in geostatistics and machine learning. We show how a single Gaussian process (GP) with these kernels can computationally and statistically outperform both separable and existing non-stationary non-separable approaches such as treed GPs and deep GP constructions. </p>

> <p>Estimating the score, i.e., the gradient of log density function, from a set of samples generated by an unknown distribution is a fundamental task in inference and learning of probabilistic models that involve flexible yet intractable densities. Kernel estimators based on Stein's methods or score matching have shown promise, however their theoretical properties and relationships have not been fully-understood. We provide a unifying view of these estimators under the framework of regularized nonparametric regression. It allows us to analyse existing estimators and construct new ones with desirable properties by choosing different hypothesis spaces and regularizers. A unified convergence analysis is provided for such estimators. Finally, we propose score estimators based on iterative regularization that enjoy computational benefits from curl-free kernels and fast convergence.</p>

> <p>This paper employs a formal connection of machine learning with thermodynamics to characterize the quality of learnt representations for transfer learning. We discuss how information-theoretic functionals such as rate, distortion and classification loss of a model lie on a convex, so-called equilibrium surface. We prescribe dynamical processes to traverse this surface under constraints, e.g., an iso-classification process that trades off rate and distortion to keep the classification loss unchanged. We demonstrate how this process can be used for transferring representations from a source dataset to a target dataset while keeping the classification loss constant. Experimental validation of the theoretical results is provided on standard image-classification datasets.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we aim to develop a scalable algorithm to preserve differential privacy (DP) in adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs), with certified robustness to adversarial examples. By leveraging the sequential composition theory in DP, we randomize both input and latent spaces to strengthen our certified robustness bounds. To address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness, we design an original adversarial objective function, based on the post-processing property in DP, to tighten the sensitivity of our model. A new stochastic batch training is proposed to apply our mechanism on large DNNs and datasets, by bypassing the vanilla iterative batch-by-batch training in DP DNNs. An end-to-end theoretical analysis and evaluations show that our mechanism notably improves the robustness and scalability of DP DNNs.</p>

> <p>The recent development of flexible and scalable variational inference algorithms has popularized the use of deep probabilistic models in a wide range of applications. However, learning and reasoning about high-dimensional models with non-differentiable densities are still a challenge. For such a model, inference algorithms struggle to estimate the gradients of variational objectives accurately, due to high variance in their estimates. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel variational inference algorithm for sequential data, which performs well even when the density from the model is not differentiable, for instance, due to the use of discrete random variables. The key feature of our algorithm is that it estimates future likelihoods at all time steps. The estimated future likelihoods form the core of our new low-variance gradient estimator. We formally analyze our gradient estimator from the perspective of variational objective, and show the effectiveness of our algorithm with synthetic and real datasets.</p>

> <p>Contemporary work on learning in continuous games has commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure present in machine learning problems formulated as games, instead treating them as simultaneous play games and adopting the Nash equilibrium solution concept. We deviate from this paradigm and provide a comprehensive study of learning in Stackelberg games. This work provides insights into the optimization landscape of zero-sum games by establishing connections between Nash and Stackelberg equilibria along with the limit points of simultaneous gradient descent. We derive novel gradient-based learning dynamics emulating the natural structure of a Stackelberg game using the Implicit Function Theorem and provide convergence analysis for deterministic and stochastic updates for zero-sum and general-sum games. Notably, in zero-sum games using deterministic updates, we show the only critical points the dynamics converge to are Stackelberg equilibria and provide a local convergence rate. Empirically, the proposed learning dynamics mitigate rotational behavior and exhibit benefits for training Generative Adversarial Networks compared to gradient play.</p>

  Guy Hacohen, Leshem Choshen, Daphna Weinshall [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3822-Metadata.json)
> <p>We report a series of robust empirical observations, whereby deep Neural Networks learn the examples in both the training and test sets in a similar order. This phenomenon is observed in all the commonly used benchmarks we evaluated, including many image classification benchmarks, and one text classification benchmark. While this phenomenon is strongest for models of the same architecture, it also crosses architectural boundaries - models of different architectures start by learning the same examples, after which the more powerful model may continue to learn additional examples. We further show that this pattern of results reflects the interplay between the way neural networks learn and benchmark datasets. Thus, when fixing the architecture, we show synthetic datasets where this pattern ceases to exist. When fixing the dataset, we show that other learning paradigms may learn the data in a different order. We hypothesize that our results echo how neural networks discover structure in natural datasets.</p>

> <p>Causal inference using observational data is challenging, especially in the bivariate case. Through the minimum description length principle, we link the postulate of independence between the generating mechanisms of the cause and of the effect given the cause to quantile regression. Based on this theory, we develop Quantile Causal Discovery (QCD), a new method to uncover causal relationships. Because it uses multiple quantile levels instead of the conditional mean only, QCD is adaptive not only to additive, but also to multiplicative or even location-scale generating mechanisms. To illustrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach, we perform an extensive empirical comparison on both synthetic and real datasets. This study shows that QCD is robust across different implementations of the method (i.e., the quantile regression algorithm), computationally efficient, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

  Ashish Chiplunkar, Sagar Kale, Sivaramakrishnan Natarajan Ramamoorthy [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3827-Metadata.json)
> <p>Fueled by massive data, important decision making is being automated with the help of algorithms, therefore, fairness in algorithms has become an especially important research topic. In this work, we design new streaming and distributed algorithms for the fair k-center problem that models fair data summarization. The streaming and distributed models of computation have an attractive feature of being able to handle massive data sets that do not fit into main memory. Our main contributions are: (a) the first distributed algorithm; which has provably constant approximation ratio and is extremely parallelizable, and (b) a two-pass streaming algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee matching the best known algorithm (which is not a streaming algorithm). Our algorithms have the advantages of being easy to implement in practice, being fast with linear running times, having very small working memory and communication, and outperforming existing algorithms on several real and synthetic data sets. To complement our distributed algorithm, we also give a hardness result for natural distributed algorithms, which holds for even the special case of k-center.</p>

> <p>We develop a Bayesian approach to learning from sequential data by using Gaussian processes (GPs) with so-called signature kernels as covariance functions. This allows to make sequences of different length comparable and to rely on strong theoretical results from stochastic analysis. Signatures capture sequential structure with tensors that can scale unfavourably in sequence length and state space dimension. To deal with this, we introduce a sparse variational approach with inducing tensors. We then combine the resulting GP with LSTMs and GRUs to build larger models that leverage the strengths of each of these approaches and benchmark the resulting GPs on multivariate time series (TS) classification datasets.</p>

> Deep neural networks are typically initialized with random weights, with variances chosen to facilitate signal propagation and stable gradients. It is also believed that diversity of features is an important property of these initializations. We construct a deep convolutional network with identical features by initializing almost all the weights to $0$. The architecture also enables perfect signal propagation and stable gradients, and achieves high accuracy on standard benchmarks. This indicates that random, diverse initializations are \textit{not} necessary for training neural networks. An essential element in training this network is a mechanism of symmetry breaking; we study this phenomenon and find that standard GPU operations, which are non-deterministic, can serve as a sufficient source of symmetry breaking to enable training.

> <p>In E-commerce, advertising is essential for merchants to reach their target users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiser's cumulative revenue over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However, existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single ad exposures, ignoring the contribution of each exposure to the final conversion, thus usually falls into suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed bilevel optimization framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve the exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative revenue.</p>

> <p>We describe a new approach for managing aleatoric uncertainty in the Reinforcement Learning paradigm. Instead of selecting actions according to a single statistic, we propose a distributional method based on the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation. This compares the inherent dispersion of random returns induced by actions, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the environment's uncertainty. The necessary conditions for SSD require estimators to predict quality second moments. To accommodate this, we map the distributional RL problem to a Wasserstein gradient flow, treating the distributional Bellman residual as a potential energy functional. We propose a particle-based algorithm for which we prove optimality and convergence. Our experiments characterize the algorithm performance and demonstrate how uncertainty and performance are better balanced using SSD action selection than with other risk measures.  </p>

> <p>Owing to the susceptibility of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks, there has been a great deal of work in developing (both empirically and certifiably) robust classifiers.  While most work has defended against a single type of attack, recent work has looked at defending against multiple threat models using simple aggregations of multiple attacks. However, these methods can be difficult to tune, and can easily result in imbalanced degrees of robustness to individual threat models, resulting in a sub-optimal worst-case loss over the combined threat model.  In this work, we develop a natural generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure to incorporate multiple threat models into a single attack, by taking the worst-case over all steepest descent directions. This approach has the advantage of directly converging upon a trade-off between different threat models which minimizes the worst-case performance over the union. With this approach, we are able to train standard architectures which are simultaneously robust against l<em>â, l</em>2, and l<em>1 attacks, outperforming past approaches on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and achieving adversarial accuracy of 46.1% against the union of (l</em>â,l<em>2,l</em>1) perturbations with radius= (0.03, 0.5, 12) on the latter, improving upon previous approaches which achieve 40.6% accuracy.</p>

> <p>Accurate and reliable prediction of hospital admission location is important due to resource-constraints and space availability in a clinical setting, particularly when dealing with patients who come from the emergency department. In this work we propose a student-teacher network via reinforcement learning to deal with this specific problem. A representation of the weights of the student network is treated as the state and is fed as an input to the teacher network. The teacher network's action is to select the most appropriate batch of data to train the student network on from a training set sorted according to entropy. By validating on three datasets, not only do we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tabular data and performs competitively on image recognition, but also that novel curricula are learned by the teacher network. We demonstrate experimentally that the teacher network can actively learn about the student network and guide it to achieve better performance than if trained alone.</p>

> <p>Options have been shown to be an effective tool in reinforcement learning, facilitating improved exploration and learning. In this paper, we present an approach based on spectral graph theory and derive an algorithm that systematically discovers options without access to a specific reward or task assignment. As opposed to the common practice used in previous methods, our algorithm makes full use of the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Incorporating modes associated with higher graph frequencies unravels domain subtleties, which are shown to be useful for option discovery. Using geometric and manifold-based analysis, we present a theoretical justification for the algorithm. In addition, we showcase its performance on several domains, demonstrating clear improvements compared to competing methods.</p>

> <p>We study generalized linear regression and classification for a synthetically generated dataset encompassing different problems of interest, such as learning with random features, neural networks in the lazy training regime, and the hidden manifold model.  We consider the high-dimensional regime and using the replica method from statistical physics, we provide a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalisation performance in these problems, valid in both the under- and over-parametrised regimes and for a broad choice of generalized linear model loss functions. In particular, we show how to obtain analytically the so-called double descent behaviour for logistic regression with a peak at the interpolation threshold, we illustrate the superiority of orthogonal against random Gaussian projections in learning with random features, and discuss the role played by correlations in the data generated by the hidden manifold model. Beyond the interest in these particular problems, the theoretical formalism introduced in this manuscript provides a path to further extensions to more complex tasks.</p>

> <p>Can the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM) be estimated from a single sweep through the observations -- and additionally, without being trapped at a local optimum in the likelihood surface? That is the premise of recent method of moments algorithms devised for HMMs. In these, correlations between consecutive pair- or triplet-wise observations are empirically estimated and used to compute estimates of the HMM parameters. Albeit computationally very attractive, the main drawback is that by restricting to only low-order correlations in the data, information is being neglected which results in a loss of accuracy (compared to standard maximum likelihood schemes). In this paper, we propose extending these methods (both pair- and triplet-based) by also including non-consecutive correlations in a way which does not significantly increase the computational cost (which scales linearly with the number of additional lags included). We prove strong consistency of the new methods, and demonstrate an improved performance in numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world financial time-series datasets.</p>

> <p>Motivated by applications to online advertising and recommender systems, we consider a game-theoretic model with delayed rewards and asynchronous, payoff-based feedback. In contrast to previous work on delayed multi-armed bandits, we focus on games with continuous action spaces, and we examine the long-run behavior of strategic agents that follow a no-regret learning policy (but are otherwise oblivious to the game being played, the objectives of their opponents, etc.). To account for the lack of a consistent stream of information (for instance, rewards can arrive out of order and with an a priori unbounded delay), we introduce a gradient-free learning policy where payoff information is placed in a priority queue as it arrives. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that under a standard diagonal concavity assumption, the induced sequence of play converges to Nash Equilibrium (NE) with probability 1, even if the delay between choosing an action and receiving the corresponding reward is unbounded.</p>

> <p>We propose to pre-train a unified language model for both autoencoding and partially autoregressive language modeling tasks using a novel training procedure, referred to as a pseudo-masked language model (PMLM). Given an input text with masked tokens, we rely on conventional masks to learn inter-relations between corrupted tokens and context via autoencoding, and pseudo masks to learn intra-relations between masked spans via partially autoregressive modeling. With well-designed position embeddings and self-attention masks, the context encodings are reused to avoid redundant computation. Moreover, conventional masks used for autoencoding provide global masking information, so that all the position embeddings are accessible in partially autoregressive language modeling. In addition, the two tasks pre-train a unified language model as a bidirectional encoder and a sequence-to-sequence decoder, respectively. Our experiments show that the unified language models pre-trained using PMLM achieve new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks across several widely used benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a promising avenue for probabilistic modeling, as they permit a wide range of exact and efficient inference routines. Recent ``deep-learning-style'' implementations of PCs strive for a better scalability, but are still difficult to train on real-world data, due to their sparsely connected computational graphs. In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel implementation design for PCs, improving prior art in several regards. At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be used as faithful generative image models.</p>

> <p>This paper studies how to sketch element-wise functions of low-rank matrices. Formally, given low-rank matrix A = [Aij] and scalar non-linear function f, we aim for finding an approximated low-rank representation of the (possibly high-rank) matrix [f(Aij)]. To this end, we propose an efficient sketching-based algorithm whose complexity is significantly lower than the number of entries of A, i.e., it runs without accessing all entries of [f(Aij)] explicitly. The main idea underlying our method is to combine a polynomial approximation of f with the existing tensor sketch scheme for approximating monomials of entries of A. To balance the errors of the two approximation components in an optimal manner, we propose a novel regression formula to find polynomial coefficients given A and f. In particular, we utilize a coreset-based regression with a rigorous approximation guarantee. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the proposed scheme under various machine learning tasks.</p>

> In this paper, we study inexact high-order Tensor Methods for solving convex optimization problems with composite objective. At every step of such methods, we use approximate solution of the auxiliary problem, defined by the bound for the residual in function value. We propose two dynamic strategies for choosing the inner accuracy: the first one is decreasing as $1/k^{p + 1}$, where $p \geq 1$ is the order of the method and $k$ is the iteration counter, and the second approach is using for the inner accuracy the last progress in the target objective. We show that inexact Tensor Methods with these strategies achieve the same global convergence rate as in the error-free case. For the second approach we also establish local superlinear rates (for $p \geq 2$), and propose the accelerated scheme. Lastly, we present computational results on a variety of machine learning problems for several methods and different accuracy policies.

> <p>The k-means++ algorithm of Arthur and Vassilvitskii (SODA 2007) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for solving the k-means clustering problem and is known to give an O(log k) approximation. Recently, Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML 2019) proposed augmenting k-means++ with O(k log log k) local search steps to yield a constant approximation (in expectation) to the k-means clustering problem. In this paper, we improve their analysis to show that, for any arbitrarily small constant epsilon &gt; 0, with only epsilon * k additional local search steps, one can achieve a constant approximation guarantee (with high probability in k), resolving an open problem in their paper.</p>

> <p>We want to detect whether a particular image dataset has been used to train a model. We propose a new technique, radioactive data, that makes imperceptible changes to this dataset such that any model trained on it will bear an identifiable mark. The mark is robust to strong variations such as different architectures or optimization methods. Given a trained model, our technique detects the use of radioactive data and provides a level of confidence (p-value). Our experiments on large-scale benchmarks (Imagenet), using standard architectures (Resnet-18, VGG-16, Densenet-121) and training procedures, show that we can detect usage of radioactive data with high confidence (p&lt;0.0001) even when only 1% of the data used to trained our model is radioactive.  Our method is robust to data augmentation and the stochasticity of deep network optimization.  As a result, it offers a much higher signal-to-noise ratio than data poisoning and backdoor methods.</p>

> <p>We propose a new framework for designing estimators for off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits. Our approach is based on the asymptotically optimal doubly robust estimator, but we shrink the importance weights to minimize a bound on the mean squared error, which results in a better bias-variance tradeoff in finite samples. We use this optimization-based framework to obtain three estimators: (a) a weight-clipping estimator, (b) a new weight-shrinkage estimator, and (c) the first shrinkage-based estimator for combinatorial action sets. Extensive experiments in both standard and combinatorial bandit benchmark problems show that our estimators are highly adaptive and typically outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> <p>Standard RL algorithms assume fixed environment dynamics and require a significant amount of interaction to adapt to new environments. We introduce Policy-Dynamics Value Functions (PD-VF), a novel approach for rapidly adapting to dynamics different from those previously seen in training. PD-VF explicitly estimates the cumulative reward in a space of policies and environments. An ensemble of conventional RL policies is used to gather experience on training environments, from which embeddings of both policies and environments can be learned. Then, a value function conditioned on both embeddings is trained. At test time, a few actions are sufficient to infer the environment embedding, enabling a policy to be selected by maximizing the learned value function (which requires no additional environment interaction). We show that our method can rapidly adapt to new dynamics on a set of MuJoCo domains. </p>

> <p>Probabilistic clustering models (or equivalently, mixture models) are basic building blocks in countless statistical models and involve latent random variables over discrete spaces. For these models, posterior inference methods can be inaccurate and/or very slow. In this work we introduce deep network architectures trained with labeled samples from any generative model of  clustered datasets. At test time, the networks generate approximate posterior samples of cluster labels for any new dataset of arbitrary size. We develop two complementary approaches to this task, requiring  either O(N) or O(K) network forward passes per dataset, where N is the dataset size and  K the number of clusters. Unlike previous approaches, our methods sample the labels of all the data points from a well-defined posterior, and can learn nonparametric Bayesian posteriors since they do not limit the number of mixture components. As a scientific application, we present a novel approach to neural spike sorting for high-density multielectrode arrays. </p>

> <p>We study regularization in the context of small sample-size learning with over-parametrized neural networks. Specifically, we shift focus from architectural properties, such as norms on the network weights, to properties of the internal representations before a linear classifier. Specifically, we impose a topological constraint on samples drawn from the probability measure induced in that space. This provably leads to mass concentration effects around the representations of training instances, i.e., a property beneficial for generalization. By leveraging previous work to impose topological constrains in a neural network setting, we provide empirical evidence (across various vision benchmarks) to support our claim for better generalization.</p>

> <p>Recent research shows that sublevel sets of the loss surfaces of overparameterized networks are connected, exactly or approximately. We describe and compare experimentally a panel of methods used to connect two low-loss points by a low-loss curve on this surface. Our methods vary in accuracy and complexity. Most of our methods are based on ''macroscopic'' distributional assumptions and are insensitive to the detailed properties of the points to be connected. Some methods require a prior training of a ''global connection model'' which can then be applied to any pair of points. The accuracy of the method generally correlates with its complexity and sensitivity to the endpoint detail.</p>

> <p>We propose an approach to learning with graph-structured data in the problem domain of graph classification. In particular, we present a novel type of readout operation to aggregate node features into a graph-level representation. To this end, we leverage persistent homology computed via a real-valued, learnable, filter function. We establish the theoretical foundation for differentiating through the persistent homology computation. Empirically, we show that this type of readout operation compares favorably to previous techniques, especially when the graph connectivity structure is informative for the learning problem.</p>

> <p>Embedding layers are commonly used to map discrete symbols into continuous embedding vectors that reflect their semantic meanings. Despite their effectiveness, the number of parameters in an embedding layer increases linearly with the number of symbols and poses a critical challenge on memory and storage constraints. In this work, we propose a generic and end-to-end learnable compression framework termed differentiable product quantization (DPQ). We present two instantiations of DPQ that leverage different approximation techniques to enable differentiability in end-to-end learning. Our method can readily serve as a drop-in alternative for any existing embedding layer. Empirically, DPQ offers significant compression ratios (14-238x) at negligible or no performance cost on 10 datasets across three different language tasks.</p>

> <p>Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) leverage the flexibility and interpretability of GPs while capturing structure across outputs, which is desirable, for example, in spatio-temporal modelling. The key problem with MOGPs is their computational scaling O(n^3 p^3), which is cubic in the number of both inputs n (e.g., time points or locations) and outputs p. For this reason, a popular class of MOGPs assumes that the data live around a low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing the complexity to O(n^3 m^3). However, this cost is still cubic in the dimensionality of the subspace m, which is still prohibitively expensive for many applications. We propose the use of a sufficient statistic of the data to accelerate inference and learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method achieves linear scaling in m, hence allowing these models to scale to virtually any m, without sacrificing significant expressivity or requiring approximation. This advance opens up a wide range of real-world tasks and can be combined with existing GP approximations in a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on various synthetic and real-world data sets.</p>

> This paper studies the lower bound complexity for minimax optimization problem whose objective function is the average of $n$ individual smooth convex-concave functions. We consider the algorithm which gets access to gradient and proximal oracle for each individual component. For the strongly-convex-strongly-concave case, we prove such an algorithm can not reach an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal point in fewer than $\Omega\left((n+\kappa)\log(1/\varepsilon)\right)$ iterations, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the objective function. This lower bound matches the upper bound of the existing incremental first-order oracle algorithm stochastic variance-reduced extragradient. We develop a novel construction to show the above result, which partitions the tridiagonal matrix of classical examples into $n$ groups. This construction is friendly to the analysis of incremental gradient and proximal oracle and we also extend the analysis to general convex-concave cases.

> Stochastic shortest path (SSP) is a well-known problem in planning and control, in which an agent has to reach a goal state in minimum total expected cost. In the learning formulation of the problem, the agent is unaware of the environment dynamics (i.e., the transition function) and has to repeatedly play for a given number of episodes, while learning  the problem&#x27;s optimal solution.  Unlike other well-studied models in reinforcement learning (RL), the length of an episode is not predetermined (or bounded) and is influenced by the agent&#x27;s actions.  Recently, \cite{tarbouriech2019noregret} studied this problem in the context of regret minimization, and provided an algorithm whose regret bound is inversely proportional to the square root of the minimum instantaneous cost. In this work we  remove this dependence on the minimum cost---we give an algorithm that guarantees a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(B^{3/2} S \sqrt{A K})$, where $B$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions and $K$  is the total number of episodes. We additionally show that any learning algorithm must have at least $\Omega(B \sqrt{S A K})$ regret in the worst case.

> <p>In narrow asymptotic settings Gaussian VAE models of continuous data have been shown to possess global optima aligned with ground-truth distributions. Even so, it is well known that poor solutions whereby the latent posterior collapses to an uninformative prior are sometimes obtained in practice. However, contrary to conventional wisdom that largely assigns blame for this phenomena on the undue influence of KL-divergence regularization, we will argue that posterior collapse is, at least in part, a direct consequence of bad local minima inherent to the loss surface of deep autoencoder networks. In particular, we prove that even small nonlinear perturbations of affine VAE decoder models can produce such minima, and in deeper models, analogous minima can force the VAE to behave like an aggressive truncation operator, provably discarding information along all latent dimensions in certain circumstances. Regardless, the underlying message here is not meant to undercut valuable existing explanations of posterior collapse, but rather, to refine the discussion and elucidate alternative risk factors that may have been previously underappreciated.</p>

> <p>Can deep neural networks learn to solve any task, and in particular problems of high complexity? This question attracts a lot of interest, with recent works tackling computationally hard tasks such as the traveling salesman problem and satisfiability. In this work we offer a different perspective on this question. Given the common assumption that NP != coNP we prove that any polynomial-time sample generator for an NP-hard problem samples, in fact, from an easier sub-problem. We empirically explore a case study, Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation techniques generate biased data-sets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model accuracy. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches that require training on a dense uniform sampling from the target distribution cannot be used to solve computationally hard problems, the reason being the difficulty of generating sufficiently large and unbiased training sets.</p>

> <p>Coastal communities are at high risk of natural hazards due to unremitting global warming and sea level rise. Both the catastrophic impacts, e.g., tidal flooding and storm surges, and the long-term impacts, e.g., beach erosion, inundation of low lying areas, and saltwater intrusion into aquifers, cause economic, social, and ecological losses. Creating policies through appropriate modeling of the responses of stakeholdersÂÂ, such as government, businesses, and residents, to climate change and sea level rise scenarios can help to reduce these losses. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for an agent (government) which interacts with the environment (nature and residents) to deal with the impacts of climate change, in particular sea level rise. Through theoretical analysis we show that a reasonable government's policy on infrastructure development ought to be proactive and based on detected sea levels in order to minimize the expected total cost, as opposed to a straightforward government that reacts to observed costs from nature. We also provide a deep reinforcement learning-based scenario planning tool considering different government and resident types in terms of cooperation, and different sea level rise projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). </p>

> Frank-Wolfe algorithm is an efficient method for optimizing  non-convex constrained problems. However, most of existing methods focus on the first-order case. In real-world applications, the gradient is not always available. To address the problem  of lacking gradient in many applications, we propose two new stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithms and theoretically proved that they have a faster convergence rate than existing methods for non-convex problems. Specifically, the function queries oracle of the proposed faster zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (FZFW) method is $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon^2})$  which can match the iteration complexity of the first-order counterpart approximately. As for the proposed faster zeroth-order conditional gradient sliding (FZCGS) method, its function queries oracle is  improved to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon})$, indicating that its iteration complexity is even better than that of its first-order counterpart NCGS-VR. In other words, the iteration complelxity of the  accelerated first-order Frank-Wolfe method NCGS-VR is suboptimal.  Then, we  proposed a new algorithm to improve its IFO (incremental first-order oracle) to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}}{\epsilon})$. At last, the empirical studies on benchmark datasets validate our theoretical results.

> <p>Distance metric learning (DML) is to learn a representation space equipped with a metric, such that examples from the same class are closer than examples from different classes with respect to the metric. The recent success of deep neural networks motivates many DML losses that encourage the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. However, overemphasizing intra-class compactness may potentially cause the neural networks to filter out information that contributes to discriminating examples from unseen classes, resulting in a less generalizable representation. In contrast, we propose not to penalize intra-class distances explicitly and use a Joint Representation Similarity (JRS) regularizer that focuses on penalizing inter-class distributional similarities in a DML framework. The proposed JRS regularizer diversifies the joint distributions of representations from different classes in multiple neural layers based on cross-covariance operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets (Cub-200-2011, Cars-196, and Stanford Online Products) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

> <p>In the context of an empirical Bayes model for meta-learning where a subset of model parameters is treated as latent variables, we propose a novel scheme for amortized variational inference. This approach is based on the conditional variational autoencoder framework, which allows to learn the conditional prior distribution over model parameters given limited training data. In our model, we share the same amortized inference network between the prior and posterior distributions over the model parameters. While the posterior inference leverages both the test and the train data, including the labels, the prior inference is based on the train data only.  We show that in earlier approaches based on Monte-Carlo approximation the prior collapses to a Dirac delta function. In contrast, our variational approach prevents this collapse and preserves uncertainty over the model parameters. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmark datasets, including miniImageNet, and obtain results demonstrating the advantage of our approach over previous work.</p>

  Sanghack Lee, Elias Bareinboim [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4071-Metadata.json)
> <p>Causal effect identifiability is concerned with establishing the effect of intervening on a set of variables on another set of variables from observational or interventional distributions under causal assumptions that are usually encoded in the form of a causal graph. Most of the results of this literature implicitly assume that every variable modeled in the graph is measured in the available distributions. In practice, however, the data collections of the different studies considered do not measure the same variables, consistently. In this paper, we study the causal effect identifiability problem when the available distributions may be associated with different sets of variables, which we refer to as identification under partial-observability. We study a number of properties of the factors that comprise a causal effect under various levels of abstraction, and then characterize the relationship between them with respect to their status relative to the identification of a targeted intervention. We establish a sufficient graphical criterion for determining whether the effects are identifiable from partially-observed distributions. Finally, building on these graphical properties, we develop an algorithm that returns a formula for a causal effect in terms of the available distributions.</p>

  Louis-Pascal Xhonneux, Meng Qu, Jian Tang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4075-Metadata.json)
> <p>This  paper  builds  on  the  connection  between graph  neural  networks  and  traditional  dynamical systems. We propose continuous graph neural networks (CGNN), which generalise existing graph neural networks with discrete dynamics in that they can be viewed as a specific discretisation scheme. The key idea is how to characterise the continuous dynamics of node representations, i.e. the derivatives of node representations, w.r.t. time.Inspired by existing diffusion-based methods on graphs (e.g. PageRank and epidemic models on social networks), we define the derivatives as a combination of the current node representations,the representations of neighbors, and the initial values of the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphsâincluding each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change independently or interact with each otherâboth with theoretical justification. The proposed continuous graph neural net-works are robust to over-smoothing and hence allow us to build deeper networks, which in turn are able to capture the long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on the task of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we consider the problem of sequential change-point detection where both the change-points and the distributions before and after the change are assumed to be unknown. For this key problem in statistical and sequential learning theory,  we derive a variant of the Bayesian Online Change Point Detector proposed by \cite{adams2007bayesian} which is easier to analyze than the original version while keeping its powerful message-passing algorithm.      We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the false-alarm rate and the detection delay that matches the existing lower-bound. We further provide the first explicit high-probability control of the detection delay for such approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that this proposal compares favorably with the state-of-art change-point detection strategy, namely the Improved Generalized Likelihood Ratio (Improved GLR) while outperforming the original Bayesian Online Change Point Detection strategy.</p>

> We investigate the use of a non-parametric independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), as a loss-function for learning robust regression and classification models. This loss-function encourages learning models where the distribution of the residuals between the label and the model prediction is statistically independent of the distribution of the instances themselves. This loss-function was first proposed by \citet{mooij2009regression} in the context of learning causal graphs. We adapt it to the task of learning for unsupervised covariate shift: learning on a source domain without access to any instances or labels from the unknown target domain, but with the assumption that $p(y|x)$  (the conditional probability of labels given instances) remains the same in the target domain. We show that the proposed loss is expected to give rise to models that generalize well on a class of target domains characterised by the complexity of their description within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Experiments on unsupervised covariate shift tasks  demonstrate that models learned with the proposed loss-function outperform models learned with standard loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a challenging cell-microscopy unsupervised covariate shift task.

> <p>Implicit stochastic models, where the data-generation distribution is intractable but sampling is possible, are ubiquitous in the natural sciences. The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data collected in scientific experiments. A fundamental question is how to design the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters. For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior. Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions.</p>

> Sorting is an elementary building block of modern software.  In machine learning and statistics, it is commonly used in robust statistics, order statistics and ranking metrics. However, sorting is a piecewise linear function and as a result includes many kinks at which it is non-differentiable.  More problematic, the ranking operator is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one could expect from a sorting or ranking operation. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity.  Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation.  We achieve this feat by casting differentiable sorting and ranking as projections onto a permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization.  Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches. We also showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman&#x27;s rank coefficient and differentiable least trimmed squares.

Despite this, most commonly used methods in practice focus on identifying a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by learning only from toxicity events. We present a novel adaptive clinical trial methodology, called Safe Efficacy Exploration Dose Allocation (SEEDA), that aims at maximizing the cumulative efficacies while satisfying the toxicity safety constraint with high probability. We evaluate performance objectives that have operational meanings in practical clinical trials, including cumulative efficacy, recommendation/allocation success probabilities, toxicity violation probability, and sample efficiency. An extended SEEDA-Plateau algorithm that is tailored for the increase-then-plateau efficacy behavior of molecularly targeted agents (MTA) is also presented. Through numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that SEEDA outperforms state-of-the-art clinical trial designs by finding the optimal dose with higher success rate and fewer patients.</p>

> <p>Plug-and-play (PnP) is a non-convex framework that combines ADMM or other proximal algorithms  with advanced denoiser priors.  Recently, PnP has achieved great empirical  success, especially with the integration of deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key problem of PnP based approaches is that they require manual parameter tweaking. It is necessary to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in terms of imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present a tuning-free PnP proximal algorithm, which can automatically  determine the internal parameters including  the penalty parameter, the denoising strength  and the terminal time. A key part of our approach is to develop a policy network for automatic search of parameters, which can be effectively learned via mixed model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize different parameters for different states, and often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss the practical considerations of the plugged denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield  state-of-the-art results. This is prevalent on both linear and nonlinear exemplary inverse imaging problems, and in particular, we show promising results on Compressed Sensing MRI and phase retrieval. </p>

> <p>Learning algorithms are often used in conjunction with expert decision makers in practical scenarios, however this fact is largely ignored when designing these algorithms. In this paper we explore how to learn predictors that can either predict or choose to defer the decision to a downstream expert. Given samples of the expert's decisions, we give a procedure based on learning a classifier and a rejector and analyze it theoretically. Our approach is based on a reduction to cost sensitive learning where we give a novel calibrated surrogate loss that resolves the open problem of (Ni et al., 2019) for multiclass rejection learning. We show the effectiveness of the new surrogate loss and approach on image and text classification tasks.</p>

> <p>A fundamental problem in computational chemistry is to find a set of reactants to synthesize a target molecule, a.k.a. retrosynthesis prediction. Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on matching the target molecule with a large set of reaction templates, which are very computational expensive and also suffer from the problem of coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming a target molecular graph into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits the target molecular graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers, and then translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational graph translation framework.  Experimental results show that G2Gs significantly outperforms existing template-free approaches with up to 63% improvement in terms of the top-1 accuracy and is close to the performance of state-of-the-art template-based approaches, but does not require domain knowledge and is much more scalable. </p>

> <p>We introduce and analyze a class of algorithms, called Mirror Ascent against an Improved Opponent (MAIO), for computing Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games, both in normal form and in sequential imperfect information form. These algorithms update the policy of each player with a mirror-descent step to minimize the loss of playing against an improved opponent. We establish a convergence result to the set of Nash equilibria where the speed of convergence depends on the amount of improvement of the opponent policies. In addition, if the improved opponent is a best response, then an exponential convergence rate is achieved. </p>

> <p>Selective rationalization improves neural network interpretability by identifying a small subset of input features â the rationale â that best explains or supports the prediction. A typical rationalization criterion, i.e. maximum mutual information (MMI), finds the rationale that maximizes the prediction performance based only on the rationale. However, MMI can be problematic because it picks up spurious correlations between the input features and the output.  Instead, we introduce a game-theoretic invariant rationalization criterion where the rationales are constrained to enable the same predictor to be optimal across different environments. We show both theoretically and empirically that the proposed rationales can rule out spurious correlations and generalize better to different test scenarios. The resulting explanations also align better with human judgments. </p>

> In the paper, we propose a class of accelerated stochastic gradient-free and projection-free (a.k.a., zeroth-order Frank Wolfe) methods to solve the problem of constrained stochastic and finite-sum nonconvex optimization. Specifically, we propose an accelerated stochastic zeroth-order Frank Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW) method based on the variance reduced technique and a novel momentum technique. Moreover, under some mild conditions, we prove that the Acc-SZOFW has the function query complexity of $O(d\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the finite-sum problem, which improves the exiting best result by a factor of $O(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$, and has the function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-3})$ in the stochastic problem, which improves the exiting best result by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Further, we propose a novel accelerated stochastic zeroth-order Frank Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW*) to relax the large mini-batch size required in the Acc-SZOFW. In particular, we prove that the Acc-SZOFW* still has the function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-3})$ in the stochastic problem. Finally, we use extensive experiments including black-box adversarial attack and robust black-box classification to verify the efficiency of our algorithms.

> We study the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. Inspired by the extended value iteration algorithm used in optimistic algorithms for finite MDPs, we propose to relax the optimistic optimization of \ofulq and cast it into a constrained \textit{extended} LQR problem, where an additional control variable implicitly selects the system dynamics within a confidence interval. We then move to the corresponding Lagrangian formulation for which we prove strong duality. As a result, we show that an $\epsilon$- optimistic controller can be computed efficiently by solving at most $O\big(\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$ Riccati equations. Finally, we prove that relaxing the original \ofu problem does not impact the learning performance, thus recovering the $\wt O(\sqrt{T})$ regret of \ofulq.

> Random Features (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF model with $P$ features, $N$ data points, and a ridge $\lambda$, we show that the average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an \textit{effective ridge} $\tilde{\lambda}$. We show that $\tilde{\lambda} &gt; \lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda} \searrow \lambda$ monotonically as $P$ grows, thus revealing the \textit{implicit regularization effect} of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test error) of the $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor with the average risk of the $\lambda$-RF predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally, we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average $\lambda$-RF predictor and $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor.

> <p>Missing data is a crucial issue when applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets. Starting from the simple assumption that two batches extracted randomly from the same dataset should share the same distribution, we leverage optimal transport distances to quantify that criterion and turn it into a loss function to impute missing data values. We propose practical methods to minimize these losses using end-to-end learning, that can exploit or not parametric assumptions on the underlying distributions of values. We evaluate our methods on datasets from the UCI repository, in MCAR, MAR and MNAR settings. These experiments show that OT-based methods match or out-perform state-of-the-art imputation methods, even for high percentages of missing values. </p>

> <p>Speech information can be roughly decomposed into four components: language content, timbre, pitch, and rhythm. Obtaining disentangled representations of these components is useful in many speech analysis and generation applications. Recently, state-of-the-art voice conversion systems have led to speech representations that can disentangle speaker-dependent and independent information. However, these systems can only disentangle timbre, while information about pitch, rhythm and content is still mixed together. Further disentangling the remaining speech components is an under-determined problem in the absence of explicit annotations for each component, which are difficult and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose SpeechFlow, which can blindly decompose speech into its four components by introducing three carefully designed information bottlenecks. SpeechFlow is among the first algorithms that can separately perform style transfer on timbre, pitch and rhythm without text labels.</p>

> <p>A common strategy in modern learning systems is to learn a representation that is useful for many tasks, a.k.a. representation learning. We study this strategy in the imitation learning setting for Markov decision processes (MDPs) where multiple experts' trajectories are available. We formulate representation learning  as a bi-level optimization problem where the <code>outer" optimization tries to learn the joint representation and the</code>inner" optimization encodes the imitation learning setup and tries to learn task-specific parameters. We instantiate this framework for the imitation learning settings of behavior cloning and observation-alone. Theoretically, we show using our framework that representation learning can provide sample complexity benefits for imitation learning in both settings. We also provide proof-of-concept experiments to verify our theory.</p>

> <p>Stochastic gradient methods with momentum are widely used in applications and at the core of optimization subroutines in many popular machine learning libraries. However, their sample complexities have never been obtained for problems that are non-convex and non-smooth. This paper establishes the convergence rate of a stochastic subgradient method with a momentum term of Polyak type for a broad class of non-smooth, non-convex, and constrained optimization problems. Our key innovation is the construction of a special Lyapunov function for which the proven complexity can be achieved without any tunning of the momentum parameter. For smooth problems, we extend the known complexity bound to the constrained case and demonstrate how the unconstrained case can be analyzed under weaker assumptions than the state-of-the art. Numerical results confirm our theoretical developments.</p>

> <p>Much recent progress in applications of machine learning models to NLP has been driven by benchmarks that evaluate models across a wide variety of tasks. However, these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English, and despite an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that enables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of languages and tasks is still missing. To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There is also a wide spread of results across languages. We will release the benchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer linguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and tasks.</p>

> <p>The field of algorithms has seen a push for fairness, or the removal of inherent bias, in recent history. In data summarization, where a much smaller subset of a data set is chosen to represent the whole of the data, fairness can be introduced by guaranteeing each "demographic group" a specific portion of the representative subset. Specifically, this paper examines this fair variant of the k-centers problem, where a subset of the data with cardinality k is chosen to minimize distance to the rest of the data. Previous papers working on this problem presented both a 3-approximation algorithm with a super-linear runtime and a linear-time algorithm whose approximation factor is exponential in the number of demographic groups. This paper combines the best parts of each algorithm , by presenting a linear-time algorithm with a guaranteed 3-approximation factor, and provides empirical evidence of both the algorithm's runtime and effectiveness.</p>

> <p>Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling problems, especially in cases where a method's success hinges upon its ability to faithfully represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist as parts of larger frameworks, where quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating over posterior distributions. However, these algorithms' inner workings rarely allow for closed-form integration, giving rise to a need for Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a factorization of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to efficient sampling, by allowing accurate representation of entire function draws. Building off of this factorization, we propose decoupled sampling, an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling. As a drop-in approach to sampling, decoupled sampling seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to Gaussian processes to afford scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test sampling schemes' statistical behavior and practical ramifications, we empirically show that functions drawn using decoupled sampling faithfully represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the cost.</p>

> <p>The main approach to defining equivalence among acyclic directed causal graphical models is based on the conditional independence relationships in the distributions that the causal models can generate, in terms of the Markov equivalence. However, it is known that when cycles are allowed in the causal structure, conditional independence may not be a suitable notion for equivalence of two structures, as it does not reflect all the information in the distribution that is useful for identification of the underlying structure. In this paper, we present a general, unified notion of equivalence for linear Gaussian causal directed graphical models, whether they are cyclic or acyclic. In our proposed definition of equivalence, two structures are equivalent if they can generate the same set of data distributions. We also propose a weaker notion of equivalence called quasi-equivalence, which we show is the extent of identifiability from observational data. We propose analytic as well as graphical methods for characterizing the equivalence of two structures. Additionally, we propose a score-based method for learning the structure from observational data, which successfully deals with both acyclic and cyclic structures.</p>

> <p>Evidence-based decision-making entails collecting (costly) observations about an underlying phenomenon of interest, and subsequently committing to an (informed) decision on the basis of accumulated evidence. In this setting, <em>active sensing</em> is the goal-oriented problem of efficiently selecting which acquisitions to make, and when and what decision to settle on. As its complement, <em>inverse active sensing</em> seeks to uncover an agent's preferences and strategy given their observable decision-making behavior. In this paper, we develop an expressive, unified framework for the general setting of evidence-based decision-making under endogenous, context-dependent time pressure---which requires negotiating (subjective) tradeoffs between accuracy, speediness, and cost of information. Using this language, we demonstrate how it enables <em>modeling</em> intuitive notions of surprise, suspense, and optimality in decision strategies (the forward problem). Finally, we illustrate how this formulation enables <em>understanding</em> decision-making behavior by quantifying preferences implicit in observed decision strategies (the inverse problem).</p>

> <p>With the rapid adoption of machine learning systems in sensitive applications, there is an increasing need to make black-box models explainable. Often we want to identify an influential group of training samples in a particular test prediction for a given machine learning model. Existing influence functions tackle this problem by using first-order approximations of the effect of removing a sample from the training set on model parameters. To compute the influence of a group of training samples (rather than an individual point) in model predictions, the change in optimal model parameters after removing that group from the training set can be large. Thus, in such cases, the first-order approximation can be loose. In this paper, we address this issue and propose second-order influence functions for identifying influential groups in test-time predictions. For linear models, across different sizes and types of groups, we show that using the proposed second-order influence function improves the correlation between the computed influence values and the ground truth ones. We also show that second-order influence functions could be used with optimization techniques to improve the selection of the most influential group for a test-sample.</p>

> <p>Bayesian reward learning from demonstrations enables rigorous safety and uncertainty analysis when performing imitation learning. However, Bayesian reward learning methods are typically computationally intractable for complex control problems. We propose a highly efficient Bayesian reward learning algorithm that scales to high-dimensional imitation learning problems by first pre-training a low-dimensional feature encoding via self-supervised tasks and then leveraging preferences over demonstrations to perform fast Bayesian inference via sampling. We evaluate our proposed approach on the task of learning to play Atari games from demonstrations, without access to the game score, and achieve state-of-the-art imitation learning performance. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our approach enables efficient high-confidence performance bounds for any evaluation policy. We show that these high-confidence performance bounds can be used to accurately rank the performance and risk of a variety of different evaluation policies, despite not having samples of the true reward function. </p>

> <p>Gaussian processes (GPs) provide flexible distributions over functions, with inductive biases controlled by a kernel. However, in many applications  Gaussian processes can struggle with even moderate input dimensionality. Learning a low dimensional projection can help alleviate this curse of dimensionality, but introduces many trainable hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome, especially in the small data regime. We use additive sums of kernels for GP regression, where each kernel operates on a different random projection of its inputs. Surprisingly, we find that as the number of random projections increases, the predictive performance of this approach quickly converges to the performance of a kernel operating on the original full dimensional inputs, over a wide range of data sets, even if we are projecting into a single dimension. As a consequence, many problems can remarkably be reduced to one dimensional input spaces, without learning a transformation. We prove this convergence and its rate, and additionally propose a deterministic approach that converges more quickly than purely random projections. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach can achieve faster inference and improved predictive accuracy for high-dimensional inputs compared to kernels in the original input space. </p>

> <p>Although group convolutional networks are able to learn powerful representations based on symmetry patterns, they lack explicit means to learn meaningful relationships among them (e.g., relative positions and poses). In this paper, we present attentive group equivariant convolutions, a generalization of the group convolution, in which attention is applied during the course of convolution to accentuate meaningful symmetry combinations and suppress non-plausible, misleading ones. We indicate that prior work on visual attention can be described as special cases of our proposed framework and show empirically that our attentive group equivariant convolutional networks consistently outperform conventional group convolutional networks on benchmark image datasets. Simultaneously, we provide interpretability to the learned concepts through the visualization of equivariant attention maps.</p>

> <p>Most real-world tasks are compound tasks that consist of multiple simpler sub-tasks. The main challenge of learning compound tasks is that we have no explicit supervision to learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. To address this challenge, previous imitation learning methods exploit task-specific knowledge, e.g., labeling demonstrations manually or specifying termination conditions for each sub-task. However, the need for task-specific knowledge makes it difficult to scale imitation learning to real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose an imitation learning method that can learn compound tasks without task-specific knowledge. The key idea behind our method is to leverage a self-supervised learning framework to learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. Our work also proposes a task-agnostic regularization technique to prevent unstable switching between sub-tasks, which has been a common degenerate case in previous works. We evaluate our method against several baselines on compound tasks. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on compound tasks, outperforming prior imitation learning methods.</p>

> <p>Parameter estimation, statistical tests and confidence sets are the cornerstones of classical statistics that  allow  scientists to make inferences about the underlying process that generated the observed data. A key question is whether one can still construct hypothesis tests and confidence sets with proper coverage and high power in a so-called likelihood-free inference (LFI) setting, where the likelihood is not explicitly known but one can forward-simulate observable data according to a stochastic model. In this paper, we present ACORE (Approximate Computation via Odds Ratio Estimation), a frequentist approach to LFI that first formulates the classical likelihood ratio test (LRT) as a parametrized classification problem, and then uses the equivalence of tests and confidence sets to build confidence regions for parameters of interest. We also present a goodness-of-fit test for checking whether the constructed tests and confidence regions are valid. ACORE is based on the key observation that the LRT statistic, the rejection probability of the test, and the coverage of the confidence set are  conditional distribution functions which often vary smoothly as a function of the the parameters of interest. Hence, instead of relying solely on  samples simulated at fixed parameter settings (as is the convention in standard Monte Carlo solutions), one can leverage machine learning tools and data simulated in the neighborhood of a parameter to improve estimates of quantities of interest. We demonstrate the efficacy of ACORE with both theoretical and empirical results.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks exhibit highly non-convex loss landscape, which results in complex learning dynamics under steepest gradient descent. Second order optimization methods, such as natural gradient descent, can facilitate learning by compensating for ill-conditioned curvature. However, the exact nature of such curvature-corrected learning process remains largely unknown. Here, we derive exact solutions to curvature-corrected learning rules for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Our analysis reveals that natural gradient descent follows the same path as gradient descent, only adjusting the temporal dynamics along the path. This preserves the implicit bias of gradient-based learning, such as weight balance across layers. However, block-diagonal approximations of natural gradient, which are widely used in most second order methods (e.g. K-FAC), significantly distort the dynamics to follow highly divergent paths, destroying weight balance across layers. We introduce partially curvature-corrected learning rule, which provides most of the benefit of full curvature correction in terms of convergence speed with superior numerical stability while preserving the core property of gradient descent under block-diagonal approximations.</p>

> <p>The upper confidence reinforcement learning (UCRL2) strategy introduced in \citep{jaksch2010near} is a popular method to perform regret minimization in unknown discrete Markov Decision Processes under the average-reward criterion. Despite its nice and generic theoretical regret guarantees, this strategy and its variants have remained until now mostly theoretical as numerical experiments on simple environments exhibit long burn-in phases before the learning takes place. Motivated by practical efficiency, we present UCRL3, following  the lines of UCRL2, but with two key modifications:     First, it uses state-of-the-art time-uniform concentration inequalities to compute confidence sets on the reward and transition distributions for each state-action pair. To further tighten exploration, we introduce an adaptive computation of the support of each transition distributions. This enables to revisit the extended value iteration procedure to optimize over distributions with reduced support by disregarding low probability transitions, while still ensuring near-optimism.     We demonstrate, through numerical experiments on standard environments, that reducing exploration this way yields a substantial numerical improvement compared to UCRL2 and its variants. On the theoretical side, these key modifications enable to derive a regret bound for UCRL3 improving on UCRL2,  that for the first time makes appear a notion of local diameter and effective support, thanks to variance-aware concentration bounds.</p>

> <p>Learning a good representation is an essential component for deep reinforcement learning (RL).  Representation learning is especially important in multitask and partially observable settings where building a representation of the unknown environment is crucial to solve the tasks.  Here we introduce Predictions of Bootstrapped Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more.  We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 multitask setting. </p>

> <p>We introduce a novel approach for sequence decoding, Discriminative Adversarial Search (DAS), which has the desirable properties of alleviating the effects of exposure bias without requiring external metrics. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), wherein a discriminator is used to improve the generator, our method differs from GANs in that the generator parameters are not updated at training time and the discriminator is used to drive sequence generation at inference time. </p>  <p>We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the task of Abstractive Summarization: the results obtained show that a naive application of DAS improves over the state-of-the-art methods, with further gains obtained via discriminator retraining. Moreover, we show how DAS can be effective for cross-domain adaptation. Finally, all results reported are obtained without additional rule-based filtering strategies, commonly used by the best performing systems available: this indicates that DAS can effectively be deployed without relying on post-hoc modifications of the generated outputs.</p>

> <p>The Optimal transport (OT) problem and its associated Wasserstein distance have recently become a topic of great interest in the machine learning community. However, the underlying optimization problem is known to have two major restrictions: (i) it largely depends on the choice of the cost function and (ii) its sample complexity scales exponentially with the dimension. In this paper, we propose a general formulation of a minimax OT problem that can tackle these restrictions by jointly optimizing the cost matrix and the transport plan, allowing us to define a robust distance between distributions. We propose to use a cutting-set method to solve this general problem and show its links and advantages compared to other existing minimax OT approaches. Additionally, we use this method to define a notion of stability allowing us to select the most robust cost matrix. Finally, we provide an experimental study highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</p>

> <p>Generalization across environments is critical to the successful application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world challenges. In this work we propose a method for learning state abstractions which generalize to novel observation distributions in the multi-environment RL setting. We prove that for certain classes of environments, this approach outputs, with high probability, a state abstraction corresponding to the causal feature set with respect to the return. We give empirical evidence that analogous methods for the nonlinear setting can also attain improved generalization over single- and multi-task baselines. Lastly, we provide bounds on model generalization error in the multi-environment setting, in the process showing a connection between causal variable identification and the state abstraction framework for MDPs.</p>

> <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a computational approach to fundamental problems such as inference, integration, optimization, and simulation. The field has developed a broad spectrum of algorithms, varying in the way they are motivated, the way they are applied and how efficiently they sample. Despite all the differences, many of them share the same core principle, which we unify as the Involutive MCMC (iMCMC) framework. Building upon this, we describe a wide range of MCMC algorithms in terms of iMCMC, and formulate a number of "tricks" which one can use as design principles for developing new MCMC algorithms. Thus, iMCMC provides a unified view of many known MCMC algorithms, which facilitates the derivation of powerful extensions. We demonstrate the latter with two examples where we transform known reversible MCMC algorithms into more efficient irreversible ones.</p>

> Adversarial or test time robustness measures the susceptibility of a classifier to perturbations to the test input. While there has been a flurry of recent work on designing defenses against such perturbations, the theory of adversarial robustness is not well understood. In order to make progress on this, we focus on the problem of understanding generalization in adversarial settings, via the lens of Rademacher complexity.  We give upper and lower bounds for the adversarial empirical Rademacher complexity of linear hypotheses with adversarial perturbations measured in $l_r$-norm for an arbitrary $r \geq 1$. This generalizes the recent result of Yin et al.~\cite{YinRamchandranBartlett2019} that studies the case of $r = \infty$, and provides a finer analysis of the dependence on the input dimensionality as compared to the recent work of Khim and Loh~\cite{khim2018adversarial} on linear hypothesis classes and additionally provides matching lower bounds.  We then extend our analysis to provide Rademacher complexity lower and upper bounds for a single ReLU unit. Finally, we give adversarial Rademacher complexity bounds for feed-forward neural networks with one hidden layer. Unlike previous works we directly provide bounds on the adversarial Rademacher complexity of the given network, as opposed to a bound on a surrogate. A by-product of our analysis also leads to tighter bounds for the Rademacher complexity of linear hypotheses, for which we give a detailed analysis and present a comparison with existing bounds.

> Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with great empirical successes in various domains.  However, the large search space of training a neural network requires a significant amount of data, which makes the current RL algorithms not sample efficient. Motivated by the fact that many environments with continuous state space have smooth transitions, we propose to learn a smooth policy that behaves smoothly with respect to the state. In contrast to policy parameterized by linear/reproducing kernel functions, where simple regularization techniques suffice to control smoothness, for neural network based reinforcement learning algorithms, there is no readily available solution to learn a smooth policy. In this paper, we develop a new training framework --- \textbf{S}mooth \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning ($\textbf{SR}^2\textbf{L}$), where the policy is trained with smoothness-inducing regularization. Such regularization effectively constrains the search space of the learning algorithms and enforces smoothness in the learned policy. We apply the proposed framework to both on-policy (TRPO) and off-policy algorithm (DDPG). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves improved sample efficiency.

> The goal of compressed sensing is to learn a structured signal $x$ from a limited number of noisy linear measurements $y \approx Ax$.  In traditional compressed sensing, ``structure&#x27;&#x27; is represented by sparsity in some known basis.  Inspired by the success of deep learning in modeling images, recent work starting with Bora et.al has instead considered structure to come from a generative model $G: \R^k \to \R^n$. In this paper, we prove results that (i)establish the difficulty of this task and show that existing bounds are tight and (ii) demonstrate that the latter task is a generalization of the former.  First, we provide a lower bound matching the upper bound of Bora et.al. for compressed sensing from $L$-Lipschitz generative models $G$.  In particular, there exists such a function that requires roughly $\Omega(k \log L)$ linear measurements for sparse recovery to be possible. This holds even for the more relaxed goal of \emph{nonuniform} recovery.  Second, we show that generative models generalize sparsity as a representation of structure. In particular, we construct a ReLU-based neural network $G: \R^{k} \to \R^n$ with $O(1)$ layers and $O(n)$ activations per layer, such that the range of $G$ contains all $k$-sparse vectors.

> <p>Few-shot learning attempts to generalize to unlabeled query samples of new classes, which are unseen during training, given just a few labeled examples of those classes. It has received substantial research interest recently, with a large body of works based on complex meta-learning strategies and architecture  choices. We propose a Laplacian-regularization objective for few-shot tasks, which  integrates two types of potentials: (1) unary potentials assigning query samples to the nearest class prototype and (2) pairwise Laplacian potentials encouraging nearby query samples to have consistent predictions.We optimize a tight upper bound of a concave-convex relaxation of our objective, thereby guaranteeing convergence, while computing independent updates for each query sample. Following the standard experimental setting for few-shot learning, our LaplacianShot technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, while using simple cross-entropy training on the base classes. In the 1-shot setting on the standard miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks, and on the recent meta-iNat benchmark, across various networks, LaplacianShot consistently pro-vides 3 â 4% improvement in accuracy over the best-performing state-of-the-art method.</p>

> <p>Learning how to predict future events from patterns of past events is difficult when the set of possible event types is large. Many of the patterns detected in the data by training an everything-affects-everything model will be spurious. To exploit known structure, we propose using a deductive database to track facts over time, where each fact has a time-varying stateâa vector computed by a neural net whose topology is determined by the factâs provenance and experience. The possible events at any time correspond to structured facts, whose probabilities are modeled along with their states. In both synthetic and real-world domains, we show that neural models derived from concise Datalog programs achieve better generalization by encoding appropriate domain knowledge into the model architecture.</p>

> <p>When quantizing neural networks, assigning each floating-point weight to its nearest fixed-point value is the predominant approach. We find that, perhaps surprisingly, this is not the best we can do. In this paper, we propose AdaRound, a better weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization that adapts to the data and the task loss. AdaRound is fast, does not require fine-tuning of the network, and only uses a small amount of unlabelled data. We start by theoretically analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural network. By approximating the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the rounding task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local loss and propose to optimize this loss with a soft relaxation. AdaRound not only outperforms rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks. Without fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4 bits while staying within an accuracy loss of 1%.</p>

> <p>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular methodology to tune the hyperparameters of expensive black-box functions. Traditionally, BO focuses on a single task at a time and is not designed to leverage information from related functions, such as tuning performance objectives of the same algorithm across multiple datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to achieve transfer learning across different datasets as well as different objectives. The main idea is to regress the mapping from hyperparameter to objective quantiles with a semi-parametric Gaussian Copula distribution, which provides robustness against different scales or outliers that can occur in different tasks. We introduce two methods to leverage this estimation: a Thompson sampling strategy as well as a Gaussian Copula process using such quantile estimate as a prior. We show that these strategies can combine the estimation of multiple objectives such as latency and accuracy, steering the optimization toward faster predictions for the same level of accuracy. Experiments on an extensive set of hyperparameter tuning tasks demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.</p>

> The problem of scheduling of workloads onto heterogeneous processors (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) is of fundamental importance in modern datacenters. Current system schedulers rely on application/system-specific heuristics that have to be built on a case-by-case basis. Recent work has demonstrated ML techniques to automate this heuristic search using black box approaches which require significant training data and time, which make them challenging to use in practice. This paper addresses the challenge in two ways:  (i) a domain-driven Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) model for scheduling, which inherently models the resource dependencies identified from the  system architecture; and (ii) a sampling-based technique which allows the computation of gradients of a Bayesian model without performing full probabilistic inference. Together, these techniques reduce both the amount of training-data and -time required to produce scheduling policies that significantly outperform black box approaches by up to 2.2$\times$.

However, the issue of adversarial robustness of models for code has gone largely unnoticed. In this work we address this gap by: (i) developing adversarial attacks for code (a domain with discrete and highly structured inputs), (ii) showing that, similar to other domains, neural models for code are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and (iii) developing a set of novel techniques that enable training robust and accurate models of code.</p>

> This paper introduces the boomerang sampler as a novel class of continuous-time non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The methodology begins by representing the target density as a density, $e^{-U}$, with respect to a prescribed (usually) Gaussian measure and constructs a continuous trajectory consisting of a piecewise circular path. The method moves from one circular orbit to another according to a rate function which can be written in terms of $U$. We demonstrate that the method is easy to implement and demonstrate empirically that it can out-perform existing benchmark piecewise deterministic Markov processes such as the bouncy particle sampler and the Zig-Zag. In the Bayesian statistics context, these competitor algorithms are of substantial interest in the large data context due to the fact that they can adopt data subsampling techniques which are exact (ie induce no error in the stationary distribution). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that we can also construct a control-variate subsampling boomerang sampler which is also exact, and which possesses remarkable scaling properties in the large data limit. We furthermore illustrate a factorised version on the simulation of diffusion bridges.

> <p>Intelligent agents should be able to learn useful representations by observing changes in their environment. We model such observations as pairs of non-i.i.d. images sharing at least one of the underlying factors of variation. First, we theoretically show that only knowing how many factors have changed, but not which ones, is sufficient to learn disentangled representations. Second, we provide practical algorithms that learn disentangled representations from pairs of images without requiring annotation of groups, individual factors, or the number of factors that have changed. Third, we perform a large-scale empirical study and show that such pairs of observations are sufficient to reliably learn disentangled representations on several benchmark data sets. Finally, we evaluate our learned representations and find that they are simultaneously useful on a diverse suite of tasks, including generalization under covariate shifts, fairness, and abstract reasoning.

> <p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently hold state-of-the-art performance in likelihood-based modeling of image and audio data. Generally, neural network based ARMs are designed to allow fast inference, but sampling from these models is impractically slow. In this paper, we introduce the predictive sampling algorithm: a procedure that exploits the fast inference property of ARMs in order to speed up sampling, while keeping the model intact. We propose two variations of predictive sampling, namely sampling with ARM fixed-point iteration and learned forecasting modules. Their effectiveness is demonstrated in two settings: i) explicit likelihood modeling on binary MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10, and ii) discrete latent modeling in an autoencoder trained on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Imagenet32. Empirically, we show considerable improvements over baselines in number of ARM inference calls and sampling speed.</p>

> <p>Standard deep generative models have latent codes that can be arbitrarily rotated, and a specific coordinate has no meaning. For manipulation and exploration of the samples, we seek a disentangled latent code where each coordinate is associated with a distinct property of the target distribution. Recent advances has been dominated by Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based methods, while training disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) remains challenging. To this end, we make two contributions: a novel approach for training disentangled GANs and a novel approach for selecting the best disentangled model. First, we propose a regularizer that achieves higher disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art VAE- and GAN-based approaches. This contrastive regularizer is inspired by a natural notion of disentanglement: latent traversal. Latent traversal refers to generating images by varying one latent code while fixing the rest. We turn this intuition into a regularizer by adding a discriminator that detects how the latent codes are coupled together, in paired examples. Next, one major weakness of all disentanglement benchmark tests is that all reported scores are  based on hyperparameters  tuned with a predefined disentangled representations on synthetic datasets. This is neither fair nor realistic, as one can arbitrarily improve the performance with more hyperparameter tuning and real datasets do not come with such supervision. We propose an unsupervised model selection scheme based on medoids. Numerical experiments confirm that  thus selected models improve upon the state-of-the-art models selected with supervised hyperparameter tuning. </p>

> <p>It is increasingly common to encounter data in the form of cross-sectional population measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings. Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model non-linear paths common in many underlying dynamic systems. We establish a link between continuous normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport to model the expected paths of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution. We present {\em TrajectoryNet}, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.</p>

> We consider a high-dimensional mixture of two Gaussians in the noisy regime where even an oracle knowing the centers of the clusters misclassifies a small but finite fraction of the points.  We provide a rigorous analysis of the generalization error of regularized convex classifiers, including ridge, hinge and logistic regression, in the high-dimensional limit where the number $n$ of samples and their dimension $d$ goes to infinity while their ratio is fixed to $\alpha=n/d$.   We discuss surprising effects of the regularization that in some cases allows to reach the Bayes-optimal performances, we illustrate the interpolation peak at low regularization, and analyze the role of the respective sizes of the two clusters.

> <p>Normalizing flows are a powerful tool for building expressive distributions in high dimensions. So far, most of the literature has concentrated on learning flows on Euclidean spaces. Some problems however, such as those involving angles, are defined on spaces with more complex geometries, such as tori or spheres. In this paper, we propose and compare expressive and numerically stable flows on such spaces. Our flows are built recursively on the dimension of the space, starting from flows on circles, closed intervals or spheres.</p>

> Bandit learning algorithms typically involve the balance of exploration and exploitation. However, in many practical applications, worst-case scenarios needing systematic exploration are seldom encountered. In this work, we consider a smoothed setting for structured linear contextual bandits where the adversarial contexts are perturbed by Gaussian noise and the unknown parameter $\theta^*$ has structure, e.g., sparsity, group sparsity, low rank, etc. We propose simple greedy algorithms for both the single- and multi-parameter (i.e., different parameter for each context) settings and provide a unified regret analysis for $\theta^*$ with any assumed structure. The regret bounds are expressed in terms of geometric quantities such as Gaussian widths associated with the structure of $\theta^*$. We also obtain sharper regret bounds compared to earlier work for the unstructured $\theta^*$ setting as a consequence of our improved analysis. We show there is implicit exploration in the smoothed setting where a simple greedy algorithm works.

> We demonstrate two new important properties of the path-norm regularizer for shallow neural networks. First, despite its non-smoothness and non-convexity it allows a closed form proximal operator which can be efficiently computed, allowing the use of stochastic proximal-gradient-type methods for regularized empirical risk minimization. Second, it provides an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the network, which is tighter than the trivial layer-wise product of Lipschitz constants, motivating its use for training networks robust to adversarial perturbations. Finally, in practical experiments we show that it provides a better robustness-accuracy trade-off when compared to $\ell_1$-norm regularization or training with a layer-wise constrain of the Lipschitz constant.

  FranÃ§ois-Pierre Paty, Marco Cuturi [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4482-Metadata.json)
> <p>Regularizing Wasserstein distances has proved to be the key in the recent advances of optimal transport (OT) in machine learning. Most prominent is the entropic regularization of OT, which not only allows for fast computations and differentiation using Sinkhorn algorithm, but also improves stability with respect to data and accuracy in many numerical experiments. Theoretical understanding of these benefits remains unclear, although recent statistical works have shown that entropy-regularized OT mitigates classical OT's curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we adopt a more geometrical point of view, and show using Fenchel duality that any convex regularization of OT can be interpreted as ground cost adversarial. This incidentally gives access to a robust dissimilarity measure on the ground space, which can in turn be used in other applications. We propose algorithms to compute this robust cost, and illustrate the interest of this approach empirically.</p>

> <p>In self-supervised visual representation learning, a feature extractor is trained on a "pretext task" for which labels can be generated cheaply. A central challenge in this approach is that the feature extractor quickly learns to exploit low-level visual features such as color aberrations or watermarks and then fails to learn useful semantic representations. Much work has gone into identifying such "shortcut" features and hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general framework for removing shortcut features automatically. Our key assumption is that those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and datasets by training a "lens" network to make small image changes that maximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with the modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases. Additionally, the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of pretext task and dataset affects the features learned by self-supervision.</p>

> <p>Sensitive attributes such as race are rarely available to learners in real world settings as their collection is often restricted by laws and regulations. We give a scheme that allows individuals to release their sensitive information privately while still allowing any downstream entity to learn non-discriminatory predictors. We show how to adapt non-discriminatory learners to work with privatized protected attributes giving theoretical guarantees on performance. Finally, we highlight how the methodology could apply to learning fair predictors in settings where protected attributes are only available for a subset of the data.</p>

> <p>Classical linear metric learning methods have recently been extended along two distinct lines: deep metric learning methods for learning embeddings of the data using neural networks, and Bregman divergence learning approaches for extending learning Euclidean distances to more general divergence measures such as divergences over distributions.  In this paper, we introduce deep Bregman divergences, which are based on learning and parameterizing functional Bregman divergences using neural networks, and which unify and extend these existing lines of work.  We show in particular how deep metric learning formulations, kernel metric learning, Mahalanobis metric learning, and moment-matching functions for comparing distributions arise as special cases of these divergences in the symmetric setting.  We then describe a deep learning framework for learning general functional Bregman divergences, and show in experiments that this method yields superior performance on benchmark datasets as compared to existing deep metric learning approaches.  We also discuss novel applications, including a semi-supervised distributional clustering problem, and a new loss function for unsupervised data generation.</p>

> In this paper, we focus on a theory-practice gap for Adam and its variants (AMSgrad, AdamNC, etc.). In practice, these algorithms are used with a constant first-order moment parameter $\beta_{1}$ (typically between $0.9$ and $0.99$). In theory, regret guarantees for online convex optimization require a rapidly decaying $\beta_{1}\to0$ schedule. We show that this is an artifact of the standard analysis, and we propose a novel framework that allows us to derive optimal, data-dependent regret bounds with a constant $\beta_{1}$, without further assumptions. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our analysis on a wide range of different algorithms and settings.

> Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is a fundamental problem in machine learning that involves identifying the most likely configuration of a discrete-valued Markov random field. Due to the difficulty of this combinatorial problem, linear programming (LP) relaxations are commonly used to derive specialized message passing algorithms that are often interpreted as coordinate descent on the dual LP. To achieve more desirable computational properties, a number of methods regularize the LP with an entropy term, leading to a class of smooth message passing algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present randomized methods for accelerating these algorithms by leveraging techniques that underlie classical accelerated gradient methods. Crucially, the proposed algorithms incorporate the familiar steps of standard smooth message passing algorithms, which can be viewed as coordinate minimization steps. We show that the accelerated variants achieve faster rates for finding $\epsilon$-optimal points of the unregularized problem. When the LP is tight, we prove that the proposed algorithms recover the true MAP solution in fewer iterations than the best-known results.

> <p>Explaining how overparametrized neural networks simultaneously achieve low risk and zero empirical risk on benchmark datasets is an open problem. PAC-Bayes bounds optimized using variational inference (VI) have been recently proposed as a promising direction in obtaining non-vacuous bounds. We show empirically that this approach gives negligible gains when modelling the posterior as a Gaussian with diagonal covariance---known as the mean-field approximation. We investigate common explanations, such as the failure of VI due to problems in optimization or choosing a suboptimal prior. Our results suggest that investigating richer posteriors is the most promising direction forward.</p>

> We give a local search based algorithm for $k$-median ($k$-means) clustering from the perspective of individual fairness.  More precisely, for a point $x$ in a point set $P$ of size $n$, let $r(x)$ be the minimum radius such that the ball of radius $r(x)$ centered at $x$ has at least $n/k$ points from $P$. Intuitively, if a set of $k$ random points are chosen from $P$ as centers, every point $x\in P$ expects to have a center within radius $r(x)$. An individually fair clustering provides such a guarantee for every point $x\in P$. This notion of fairness was introduced in [Jung et al., 2019] where they showed how to get an approximately feasible $k$-clustering with respect to this fairness condition.  In this work, we show how to get an approximately \emph{optimal} such fair $k$-clustering. The $k$-median ($k$-means) cost of our solution is within a constant factor of the cost of an optimal fair $k$-clustering, and our solution approximately satisfies the fairness condition (also within a constant factor).

> <p>We show that the bijectivity of normalising flows means they are misspecified for modelling target densities whose support has a different topology from the prior. In this case, we prove that the flow must become arbitrarily close to noninvertible in order even to approximate the target closely. This result has implications for all flow-based models, and particularly residual flows (ResFlows), which explicitly control the Lipschitz constant of the bijection used. To address this, we propose continuously indexed flows (CIFs), which replace the single bijection used by normalising flows with a continuously indexed family of bijections, and which intuitively allow rerouting mass that would be misplaced by a single bijection. We prove that CIFs can exactly match the support of the target even when its topology differs from the prior, and obtain empirically better performance for a variety of models on a variety of benchmarks.</p>

> <p>We investigate an active \emph{pure-exploration} setting, that includes \emph{best-arm identification}, in the context of \emph{linear stochastic bandits}.  While asymptotically optimal algorithms exist for standard \emph{multi-armed bandits}, the existence of such algorithms for the best-arm identification in linear bandits has been elusive despite several attempts to address it.  First, we provide a thorough comparison and new insight over different notions of optimality in the linear case, including G-optimality, transductive optimality from optimal experimental design and asymptotic optimality.  Second, we design the first asymptotically optimal algorithm for fixed-confidence pure exploration in linear bandits. As a consequence, our algorithm naturally bypasses the pitfall caused by a simple but difficult instance, that most prior algorithms had to be engineered to deal with explicitly.  Finally, we avoid the need to fully solve an optimal design problem by providing an approach that entails an efficient implementation. </p>

> <p>Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machine (AMM) is an online algorithm for learning Multi-hyperplane Machine (MM), a classification model which allows multiple hyperplanes per class. AMM is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with training time comparable to linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and significantly higher accuracy. On the other hand, empirical results indicate there is a large accuracy gap between AMM and non-linear SVMs. In this paper we show that this performance gap is not due to limited representability of MM model, as it can represent arbitrary concepts. We set to explain a connection between AMM and LVQ, and introduce a novel Growing AMM (GAMM) algorithm motivated by Growing LVQ, that imputes duplicate hyperplanes into MM model during SGD training. We provide theoretical results showing that GAMM has favorable convergence properties, and analyze the generalization bound of MM models. Experiments indicate that GAMM achieves significantly improved accuracy on non-linear problems with only slightly slower training compared to AMM. On some tasks GAMM is even more accurate than non-linear SVM and other popular classifiers such as Neural Networks and Random Forests.</p>

> <p>This paper investigates the intriguing question of whether we can create learning algorithms that automatically generate training data, learning environments, and curricula in order to help AI agents rapidly learn. We show that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We then differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have the beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data or training environment, making their potential impact large. This paper introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for neural architecture search (NAS), which is rate-limited by such evaluations, enabling massive speed-ups in NAS. GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art, finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the art approaches, which achieve top performance while using orders of magnitude less computation than typical NAS methods. Speculating forward, GTNs may represent a first step toward the ambitious goal of algorithms that generate their own training data and, in doing so, open a variety of interesting new research questions and directions.</p>

> <p>Annotating datasets is one of the main costs in nowadays supervised learning.   The goal of weak supervision is to enable models to learn using only forms of   labelling which are cheaper to collect, as partial labelling. This is a type of   incomplete annotation where, for each datapoint, supervision is cast as a set   of labels containing the real one.  The problem of supervised learning with   partial labelling has been studied for specific instances such as   classification, multi-label, ranking or segmentation, but a general framework   is still missing. This paper provides a unified framework based on structured   prediction and on the concept of {\em infimum loss} to deal with partial   labelling over a wide family of learning problems and loss functions. The   framework leads naturally to explicit algorithms that can be easily   implemented and for which proved statistical consistency and learning rates.   Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed approach over commonly   used baselines. </p>

> <p>Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their variants have been widely used in a variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and disentangled representation learning. However, the existing VAE models have some limitations in different applications. For example, a VAE easily suffers from KL vanishing in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for disentangling. To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training. The framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling, disentangled representation learning, and image generation. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve better disentangling and reconstruction quality than the existing methods. For language modelling, it not only averts the KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text. Finally, we also demonstrate that ControlVAE improves the reconstruction quality of generated images compared to the original VAE.</p>

> <p>There has been a growing realization of the potential of Bayesian machine learning as a platform that can provide both flexible modeling, accurate predictions as well as coherent uncertainty statements. In particular, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) have emerged as one of todayâs most effective general approaches to predictive modeling under minimal assumptions. Statistical theoretical developments for machine learning have been mostly concerned with approximability or rates of estimation when recovering infinite dimensional objects (curves or densities). Despite the impressive array of available theoretical results, the literature has been largely silent about uncertainty quantification. In this work, we continue the theoretical investigation of BART initiated recently by Rockova and van der Pas (2017). We focus on statistical inference questions. In particular, we study the Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) phenomenon (i.e. asymptotic normality) for smooth linear functionals of the regression surface within the framework of non-parametric regression with fixed covariates. Our semi-parametric BvM results show that, beyond rate-optimal estimation, BART can be also used for valid statistical inference. </p>

> <p>We propose a method for training a deterministic deep model that can find and reject out of distribution data points at test time with a single forward pass. Our approach, deterministic uncertainty quantification (DUQ), builds upon ideas of RBF networks. We scale training in these with a novel loss function and centroid updating scheme. By enforcing detectability of changes in the input using a gradient penalty, we are able to reliably detect out of distribution data. Our uncertainty quantification scales well to large datasets, and using a single model, we improve upon Deep Ensembles on notable difficult dataset pairs such as FashionMNIST vs. MNIST, and CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p>

  Olivier Gouvert, Thomas Oberlin, Cedric Fevotte [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4539-Metadata.json)
> <p>We introduce a new non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for ordinal data, called OrdNMF. Ordinal data are categorical data which exhibit a natural ordering between the categories. In particular, they can be found in recommender systems, either with explicit data (such as ratings) or implicit data (such as quantized play counts). OrdNMF is a probabilistic latent factor model that generalizes Bernoulli-Poisson factorization (BePoF) and Poisson factorization (PF) applied to binarized data. Contrary to these methods, OrdNMF circumvents binarization and can exploit a more informative representation of the data. We design an efficient variational algorithm based on a suitable model augmentation and related to variational PF. In particular, our algorithm preserves the scalability of PF and can be applied to huge sparse datasets. We report recommendation experiments on explicit and implicit datasets, and show that OrdNMF outperforms BePoF and PF applied to binarized data.</p>

> <p>A graph generative model takes a graph as input and is supposed to generate new graphs that ``look like'' the input graph. While most classical models focus on few, hand-selected graph statistics and are too simplistic to reproduce real-world graphs, NetGAN recently emerged as an attractive alternative: by training a GAN to learn the random walk distribution of the input graph, the algorithm is able to reproduce a large number of important network patterns simultaneously, without explicitly specifying any of them. In this paper, we investigate the implicit bias of NetGAN. We find that the root of its generalization properties does not lie in the GAN architecture, but in an inconspicuous low-rank approximation of the logits random walk transition matrix. Step by step we can strip NetGAN of all unnecessary parts, including the GAN, and obtain a highly simplified reformulation that achieves comparable generalization results, but is orders of magnitudes faster and easier to adapt. Being much simpler on the conceptual side, we reveal the implicit inductive bias of the algorithm  --- an important step towards increasing the interpretability, transparency and acceptance of machine learning systems.</p>

> <p>We study a general class of bilevel optimization problems, in which the upper-level objective is defined via the solution of a fixed point equation. Important instances arising in machine learning include hyper-parameter optimization, meta-learning, graph and recurrent neural networks. Typically the gradient of the upper-level objective is not known explicitly or is hard to compute exactly, which has raised the interest in approximation methods. We investigate two popular approaches to compute the hypergradient, based on reverse mode iterative differentiation and approximate implicit differentiation. We present a unified analysis which allows for the first time to quantitatively compare these methods, providing explicit bounds for their iteration complexity. This analysis suggests a hierarchy in terms of computational efficiency among the above methods, with approximate implicit differentiation based on conjugate gradient performing best. We present an extensive experimental comparison among the methods which confirm the theoretical findings.</p>

> <p>Autonomous agents that must exhibit flexible and broad capabilities will need to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing goal reaching performance together with the entropy of the goal distribution, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. We prove that, under regularity conditions, Skew-Fit converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that combining Skew-Fit for learning goal distributions with existing goal-reaching methods outperforms a variety of prior methods on open-sourced visual goal-reaching tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Skew-Fit enables a real-world robot to learn to open a door, entirely from scratch, from pixels, and without any manually-designed reward function.</p>

> <p>Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data.</p>

> <p>Structured predictors require solving a combinatorial optimization problem over a large number of structures, such as dependency trees or alignments. When embedded as structured hidden layers in a neural net, argmin differentiation and efficient gradient computation are further required. Recently, SparseMAP has been proposed as a differentiable, sparse alternative to maximum a posteriori (MAP) and marginal inference. SparseMAP returns an interpretable combination of a small number of structures; its sparsity being the key to efficient optimization. However, SparseMAP requires access to an exact MAP oracle in the structured model, excluding, e.g., loopy graphical models or logic constraints, which generally require approximate inference. In this paper, we introduce LP-SparseMAP, an extension of SparseMAP addressing this limitation via a local polytope relaxation. LP-SparseMAP uses the flexible and powerful language of factor graphs to define expressive hidden structures, supporting coarse decompositions, hard logic constraints, and higher-order correlations. We derive the forward and backward algorithms needed for using LP-SparseMAP as a structured hidden or output layer. Experiments in three structured tasks show benefits versus SparseMAP and Structured SVM.</p>

> <p>Game-theoretic formulations of feature importance have become popular as a way to "explain" machine learning models. These methods define a cooperative game between the features of a model and distribute influence among these input elements using some form of the game's unique Shapley values. Justification for these methods rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning. We also draw on additional literature to argue that Shapley values do not provide explanations which suit human-centric goals of explainability.</p>

> <p>Model-free reinforcement learning is known to be memory and computation efficient and more amendable to large scale problems. In this paper, two model-free algorithms are introduced for learning infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The first algorithm reduces the problem to the discounted-reward version and achieves O(T^{2/3}) regret after T steps, under the minimal assumption of weakly communicating MDPs. The second algorithm makes use of recent advances in adaptive algorithms for adversarial multi-armed bandits and improves the regret to O(\sqrt{T}), albeit with a stronger ergodic assumption. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first model-free algorithms with sub-linear regret (that is polynomial in all parameters) in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting.</p>

> <p>Gaussian processes (GP) are one of the most successful frameworks to model uncertainty. However, GP optimization (e.g., GP-UCB) suffers from major scalability issues. Experimental time grows linearly with the number of evaluations, unless candidates are selected in batches (e.g., using GP-BUCB) and evaluated in parallel. Furthermore, computational cost is often prohibitive since algorithms such as GP-BUCB require a time at least quadratic in the number of dimensions and iterations to select each batch.</p>  <p>In this paper, we introduce BBKB (Batch Budgeted Kernel Bandits), the first no-regret GP optimization algorithm that provably runs in near-linear time and selects candidates in batches. This is obtained with a new guarantee for the tracking of the posterior variances that allows BBKB to choose increasingly larger batches, improving over GP-BUCB. Moreover, we show that the same bound can be used to adaptively delay costly updates to the sparse GP approximation used by BBKB, achieving a near-constant per-step amortized cost. These findings are then confirmed in several experiments, where BBKB is much faster than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

> In this work, we give a new parallel algorithm for the problem of maximizing a non-monotone diminishing returns submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. For any desired accuracy $\epsilon$, our algorithm achieves a $1/e - \epsilon$ approximation using $O(\log{n} \log(1/\epsilon) / \epsilon^3)$ parallel rounds of function evaluations. The approximation guarantee nearly matches the best approximation guarantee known for the problem in the sequential setting and the number of parallel rounds is nearly-optimal for any constant $\epsilon$. Previous algorithms achieve worse approximation guarantees using $\Omega(\log^2{n})$ parallel rounds. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our algorithm obtains solutions whose objective value nearly matches the value obtained by the state of the art sequential algorithms, and it outperforms previous parallel algorithms in number of parallel rounds, iterations, and solution quality.

> <p>We study reward maximisation in a wide class of structured stochastic multi-armed bandit problems, where the mean rewards of arms satisfy some given structural constraints, e.g. linear, unimodal, sparse, etc. Our aim is to develop methods that are \emph{flexible} (in that they easily adapt to different structures), \emph{powerful} (in that they perform well empirically and/or provably match instance-dependent lower bounds) and \emph{efficient} in that the per-round computational burden is small. We develop asymptotically optimal algorithms from instance-dependent lower-bounds using iterative saddle-point solvers. Our approach generalises recent iterative methods for pure exploration to reward maximisation, where a major challenge arises from the estimation of the sub-optimality gaps and their reciprocals. Still we manage to achieve all the above desiderata. Notably, our technique avoids the computational cost of the full-blown saddle point oracle employed by previous work, while at the same time enabling finite-time regret bounds.  Our experiments reveal that our method successfully leverages the structural assumptions, while its regret is at worst comparable to that of vanilla UCB.</p>

> <p>A fundamental question in modern machine learning is how overparameterized deep neural networks can generalize. We address this question using 1) an equivalence between training infinitely wide neural networks and performing kernel regression with a deterministic kernel called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and 2) theoretical tools from statistical physics. We derive analytical expressions for learning curves for kernel regression, and use them to evaluate how the test loss of a trained neural network depends on the number of samples. Our approach allows us not only to compute the total test risk but also the decomposition of the risk due to different spectral components of the kernel. Complementary to recent results showing that during gradient descent, neural networks fit low frequency components first, we identify a new type of frequency principle: as the size of the training set size grows, kernel machines and neural networks begin to fit successively higher frequency modes of the target function. We verify our theory with simulations of kernel regression and training wide artificial neural networks. </p>

> <p>We consider the problem of estimating a ranking on a set of items from noisy pairwise comparisons given item features. We address the observation that pairwise comparison data often reflects irrational choice, e.g. intransitivity. Our key observation is that two items compared in isolation from other items may be compared based on only a salient subset of features. Formalizing this framework, we propose the \textit{salient feature preference model} and prove a sample complexity result for learning the parameters of our model and the underlying ranking with maximum likelihood estimation. We also provide empirical results that support our theoretical bounds and illustrate how our model explains systematic intransitivity. Finally we demonstrate the strong performance of maximum likelihood estimation of our model on both synthetic data and two real data sets: the UT Zappos50K data set and comparison data about the compactness of legislative districts in the United States.</p>

> <p>There is a growing amount of literature on the relationship between wide neural networks (NNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs), identifying equivalence between the two for a variety of NN architectures. This equivalence enables, for instance, accurate approximation of the behaviour of wide Bayesian NNs without MCMC or variational approximations, or characterisation of the distribution of randomly initialised wide NNs optimised by gradient descent without ever running an optimiser. We provide a rigorous extension of these results to NNs involving attention layers, showing that unlike single-head attention, which induces non-Gaussian behaviour, multi-head attention architectures behave as GPs as the number of heads tends to infinity.  We further discuss the effects of positional encodings and layer normalisation, and propose modifications of the attention mechanism which lead to improved results for both finite and infinitely wide NNs. We evaluate attention kernels empirically, leading to a moderate improvement upon the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 for GPs without trainable kernels and advanced data preprocessing. Finally, we release code allowing applications of NNGP/NTK models, with and without attention, to variable-length sequences, with an example on the IMDb reviews dataset.</p>

> <p>Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have made great progress recently on learning from graph-structured data in practice, their theoretical guarantee on generalizability remains elusive in the literature. In this paper, we provide a theoretically-grounded generalizability analysis of GNNs with one hidden layer for both regression and binary classification problems. Under the assumption that there exists a ground-truth GNN model (with zero generalization error), the objective of GNN learning is to estimate the ground-truth GNN parameters from the training data. To achieve this objective, we propose a learning algorithm that is built on tensor initialization and accelerated gradient descent. We then show that the proposed learning algorithm converges to the ground-truth GNN model for the regression problem, and to a model sufficiently close to the ground-truth for the binary classification problem. Moreover, for both cases, the convergence rate of the proposed learning algorithm is proven to be linear and faster than the vanilla gradient descent algorithm. We further explore the relationship between the sample complexity of GNNs and their underlying graph properties. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm for GNNs.</p>

> <p>Domain generalization refers to the task of training a model which generalizes to new domains that  are  not  seen  during  training.   We  present CSD (Common Specific Decomposition), for this setting, which jointly learns a common component (which generalizes to new domains) and a domain specific component (which overfits on training domains).  The domain specific components are discarded after training and only the common component is retained. The algorithm is extremely simple and involves only modifying the final linear classification layer of any given neural network architecture.  We show that CSD either matches or beats state of the art approaches for domain generalization based on domain erasure and domain perturbed data augmentation. Further diagnostics on rotated MNIST, where domains are interpretable, confirm the hypothesis that CSD successfully disentangles common and domain specific components and hence leads to better domain generalization.</p>

> We propose a reward function estimation framework for inverse reinforcement learning with deep energy-based policies. Our method sequentially estimates the policy, the $Q$-function, and the reward. We refer to it as the PQR method. This method does not require the assumption that the reward depends on the state only, but instead allows also for dependency on the choice of action. Moreover, the method allows for the state transitions to be stochastic. To accomplish this, we assume the existence of one anchor action whose reward is known, typically the action of doing nothing, yielding no reward. We present both estimators and algorithms for the PQR method. When the environment transition is known, we prove that the reward estimator of PQR uniquely recovers the true reward. With unknown transitions, convergence analysis is presented for the PQR method. Finally, we apply PQR to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of reward estimation compared to competing methods.

> <p>We study online learning settings in which experts act strategically to maximize their influence on the learning algorithm's predictions by potentially misreporting their beliefs about a sequence of binary events. Our goal is twofold. First, we want the learning algorithm to be no-regret with respect to the best fixed expert in hindsight. Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each expert's best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each event.  To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms, a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information settings.  In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible. Finally, we identify an incentive-compatible algorithm for forward-looking strategic agents that exhibits diminishing regret in practice.</p>

> <p>Recent work has shown how predictive modeling can endow agents with rich knowledge of their surroundings, improving their ability to act in complex environments. We propose question-answering as a general paradigm to decode and understand the representations that such agents develop, applying our method to two recent approaches to predictive modelling - action-conditional CPC (Guo et al., 2018) and SimCore (Gregor et al., 2019). After training agents with these predictive objectives in a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of objects, colors, shapes, and spatial configurations, we probe their internal state representations with a host of synthetic (English) questions, without backpropagating gradients from the question-answering decoder into the agent. The performance of different agents when probed in this way reveals that they learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information about objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment. Our approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret the responses of the model as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e. applicable to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of objects, quantities, properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn, question-conditional agent probing can stimulate the design and development of stronger predictive learning objectives.</p>

> <p>We investigate meta-learning procedures in the setting of stochastic linear bandits tasks. The goal is to select a learning algorithm which works well on average over a class of bandits tasks, that are sampled from a task-distribution. Inspired by recent work on learning-to-learn linear regression, we consider a class of bandit algorithms that implement a regularized version of the well-known OFUL algorithm, where the regularization is a square euclidean distance to a bias vector. We first study the benefit of the biased OFUL algorithm in terms of regret minimization. We then propose two strategies to estimate the bias within the learning-to-learn setting. We show both theoretically and experimentally, that when the number of tasks grows and the variance of the task-distribution is small, our strategies have a significant advantage over learning the tasks in isolation.</p>

> <p>Decentralized stochastic optimization methods have gained a lot of attention recently, mainly because of their cheap per iteration cost, data locality, and their communication-efficiency. In this paper we introduce a unified convergence analysis that covers a large variety of decentralized SGD methods which so far have required different intuitions, have different applications, and which have been developed separately in various communities. </p>  <p>Our algorithmic framework covers local SGD updates and synchronous and pairwise gossip updates on adaptive network topology. We derive universal convergence rates for smooth (convex and non-convex) problems and the rates interpolate between the heterogeneous (non-identically distributed data) and iid-data settings, recovering linear convergence rates in many special cases, for instance for over-parametrized models. Our proofs rely on weak assumptions (typically improving over prior work in several aspects) and recover (and improve) the best known complexity results for a host of important scenarios, such as for instance coorperative SGD and federated averaging (local SGD).</p>

  Tyler Johnson, Pulkit Agrawal, Haijie Gu, Carlos Guestrin [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4682-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4682-Supplemental.pdf)
> <p>When using large-batch training to speed up stochastic gradient descent, learning rates must adapt to new batch sizes in order to maximize speed-ups and preserve model quality.  Re-tuning learning rates is resource intensive, while fixed scaling rules often degrade model quality.  We propose AdaScale SGD, an algorithm that reliably adapts learning rates to large-batch training.  By continually adapting to the gradient's variance, AdaScale automatically achieves speed-ups for a wide range of batch sizes.  We formally describe this quality with AdaScaleâs convergence bound, which maintains final objective values, even as batch sizes grow large and the number of iterations decreases.  In empirical comparisons, AdaScale trains well beyond the batch size limits of popular âlinear learning rate scalingâ rules.  This includes large-batch training with no model degradation for machine translation, image classification, object detection, and speech recognition tasks.  AdaScale's qualitative behavior is similar to that of "warm-up" heuristics, but unlike warm-up, this behavior emerges naturally from a principled mechanism. The algorithm introduces negligible computational overhead and no new hyperparameters, making AdaScale an attractive choice for large-scale training in practice.</p>

> <p>We present an algorithm, HOMER, for exploration and reinforcement learning in rich observation environments that are summarizable by an unknown latent state space. The algorithm interleaves representation learning to identify a new notion of kinematic state abstraction with strategic exploration to reach new states using the learned abstraction. The algorithm provably explores the environment with sample complexity scaling polynomially in the number of latent states and the time horizon, and, crucially, with no dependence on the size of the observation space, which could be infinitely large. This exploration guarantee further enables sample-efficient global policy optimization for any reward function. On the computational side, we  show that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently whenever certain supervised learning problems are tractable.  Empirically, we evaluate HOMER on a challenging exploration problem, where we show that the algorithm is more sample efficient than standard reinforcement learning baselines.</p>

  HaiYing Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4690-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4690-Supplemental.zip)
> <p>This paper studies binary logistic regression for rare events data, or imbalanced data, where the number of events (observations in one class, often called cases) is significantly smaller than the number of nonevents (observations in the other class, often called controls). We first derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the unknown parameter, which shows that the asymptotic variance convergences to zero in a rate of the inverse of the number of the events instead of the inverse of the full data sample size. This indicates that the available information in rare events data is at the scale of the number of events instead of the full data sample size. Furthermore, we prove that under-sampling a small proportion of the nonevents, the resulting under-sampled estimator may have identical asymptotic distribution to the full data MLE. This demonstrates the advantage of under-sampling nonevents for rare events data, because this procedure may significantly reduce the computation and/or data collection costs. Another common practice in analyzing rare events data is to over-sample (replicate) the events, which has a higher computational cost. We show that this procedure may even result in efficiency loss in terms of parameter estimation.</p>

  Wuyang Chen, Zhiding Yu, Zhangyang Wang, Anima Anandkumar [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4697-Metadata.json)
> <p>Models trained on synthetic images often face degraded generalization to real data. To remedy such domain gaps, synthetic training often starts with ImageNet pretrained models in domain generalization and adaptation as they contain the representation from real images. However, the role of ImageNet representation is seldom discussed despite common practices that leverage this knowledge implicitly to maintain generalization ability. An example is the careful hand tuning of learning rates across different network layers which can be laborious and non-scalable. We treat this as a learning without forgetting problem and propose a learning-to-optimize (L2O) method to automate layer-wise learning rates. With comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the synthetic-to-real generalization performance without seeing and training on real data, while benefiting downstream tasks such as domain adaptation.</p>

> <p>A general framework for online learning with partial information is one where feedback graphs specify which losses can be observed by the learner. We study a challenging scenario where feedback graphs vary stochastically with time and, more importantly, where graphs and losses are dependent. This scenario appears in several real-world applications that we describe where the outcome of actions are correlated. We devise a new algorithm for this setting that exploits the stochastic properties of the graphs and that benefits from favorable regret guarantees. We present a detailed theoretical analysis of this algorithm, and also report the results of a series of experiments on real-world datasets, which show that our algorithm outperforms standard baselines for online learning with feedback graphs.</p>

  Yi Tay, Dara Bahri, Liu Yang, Don Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4710-Metadata.json)
> <p>We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for learning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.</p>

> <p>A well-documented weakness of neural networks is the fact that they suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on data provided by a non-stationary distribution. Recent work in the field of continual learning attempts to understand and overcome this issue. Unfortunately, the majority of relevant work embraces the implicit assumption that the distribution of observed data is perfectly balanced. In contrast, humans and animals learn from observations that are temporally correlated and severely imbalanced. Motivated by this remark, we aim to evaluate memory population methods that are used in online continual learning, when dealing with highly imbalanced and temporally correlated streams of data. More importantly, we introduce a new memory population approach, which we call class-balancing reservoir sampling (CBRS). We demonstrate that CBRS outperforms the state-of-the-art memory population algorithms in a considerably challenging learning setting, over a range of different datasets, and for multiple architectures. Finally, we probe the computational efficiency of CBRS compared to the state of the art, both in terms of time and memory overhead. </p>

> We study the basic operation of set union in the global model of differential privacy.  In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset $W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially private Algorithm  which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world applications, and is particularly important and ubiquitous  in natural language processing (NLP) problems. For example, discovering words, sentences,  $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an instance of the set union problem.   Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a (weighted) subset of items from each user, taking the union of such  subsets, and disclosing the items whose noisy counts fall above a certain cutoff threshold. Crucially, in the above process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent from identity of items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where some itemsâ counts happen to be very large â far above the cutoff threshold. We deviate from the above paradigm, by allowing users to contribute their items in a {\em dependent fashion}, guided by a policy. In this new setting ensuring privacy is  significantly delicate.  We prove that any policy which has certain {\em contractive} properties would result in a differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using Laplace Noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the problem.

> <p>Simplex-valued data appear throughout statistics and machine learning, for example in the context of transfer learning and compression of deep networks. Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data â the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task.</p>

  Yaqi Duan, Zeyu Jia, Mengdi Wang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4735-Metadata.json)
> <p>This paper studies the statistical theory of batch data reinforcement learning with function approximation. Consider the off-policy evaluation problem, which is to estimate the cumulative value of a new target policy from logged history generated by unknown behavior policies. We study a regression-based fitted Q iteration method, and show that it is equivalent to a model-based method that estimates a conditional mean embedding of the transition operator. We prove that this method is information-theoretically optimal and has nearly minimal estimation error. In particular, by leveraging contraction property of Markov processes and martingale concentration, we establish a finite-sample instance-dependent error upper bound and a nearly-matching minimax lower bound. The policy evaluation error depends sharply on a restricted chi-square divergence over the function class between the long-term distribution of target policy and the distribution of past data. This restricted chi-square divergence is both instance-dependent and function-class-dependent. It characterizes the statistical limit of off-policy evaluation. Further, we provide an easily computable confidence bound for the policy evaluator, which may be useful for optimistic planning and safe policy improvement.</p>

> <p>Creating open-ended algorithms, which generate their own never-ending stream of novel and appropriately challenging learning opportunities, could help to automate and accelerate progress in machine learning. A recent step in this direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help elucidate its full potential.  Together, these four advances enable the most open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means.</p>

> <p>Despite the eminent successes of deep neural networks, many architectures are often hard to transfer to irregularly-sampled and asynchronous time series that commonly occur in real-world datasets, especially in healthcare applications. This paper proposes a novel approach for classifying irregularly-sampled time series with unaligned measurements, focusing on high scalability and data efficiency. Our method SeFT (Set Functions for Time Series) is based on recent advances in differentiable set function learning, extremely parallelizable with a beneficial memory footprint, thus scaling well to large datasets of long time series and online monitoring scenarios. Furthermore, our approach permits quantifying per-observation contributions to the classification outcome. We extensively compare our method with existing algorithms on multiple healthcare time series datasets and demonstrate that it performs competitively whilst significantly reducing runtime.</p>

> <p>Machine learning applications often require calibrated predictions, e.g. a 90\% credible interval should contain the true outcome 90\% of the times. However, typical definitions of calibration only require this to hold on average, and offer no guarantees on predictions made on individual samples. Thus, predictions can be systematically over or under confident on certain subgroups, leading to issues of fairness and potential vulnerabilities. </p>  <p>We show that calibration for individual samples is possible in the regression setup if and only if the predictions are randomized, i.e. outputting randomized credible intervals. Randomization removes systematic bias by trading off bias with variance. We design a training objective to enforce individual calibration and use it to train randomized regression functions. The resulting models are more calibrated for arbitrarily chosen subgroups of the data, and can achieve higher utility in decision making against adversaries that exploit miscalibrated predictions.  </p>

> <p>Traditional differential privacy is independent of the data distribution. However, this is not well-matched with the modern machine learning context, where models are trained on specific data. As a result, achieving meaningful privacy guarantees in ML often excessively reduces accuracy. We propose Bayesian differential privacy (BDP), which takes into account the data distribution to provide more practical privacy guarantees. We derive a general privacy accounting method under BDP and show that it is a generalisation of the well-known moments accountant. Our experiments demonstrate that in-distribution samples in classic machine learning datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, enjoy significantly stronger privacy guarantees than postulated by DP, while models maintain high classification accuracy.</p>

> <p>In many applications areas---lending, education, and online recommenders, for example---fairness and equity concerns emerge when a machine learning system interacts with a dynamically changing environment to produce both immediate and long-term effects for individuals and demographic groups. We discuss causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as a unifying framework for the recent literature on fairness in such dynamical systems. We show that this formulation affords several new directions of inquiry to the modeler, where sound causal assumptions can be expressed and manipulated. We emphasize the importance of computing interventional quantities in the dynamical fairness setting, and show how causal assumptions enable simulation (when environment dynamics are known) and estimation by adjustment (when dynamics are unknown) of intervention on short- and long-term outcomes, at both the group and individual levels.</p>

> <p>Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single policy that generalizes to controlling a wide variety of agent morphologies - ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. Such a policy would distill general and modular sensorimotor patterns that can be applied to control arbitrary agents. We propose a policy expressed as a collection of identical modular neural network components for each of the agentâs actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its own actuator and receives information from its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. A single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for over 20 planar morphologies such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds and generalize to variants not seen during training - a process that would normally require training and manual hyper-parameter tuning for each morphology. We observe a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerging via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.</p>

> <p>Humans can intuitively recognize objectsâ physical properties and predict their future motion, even when the objects are engaged in complicated interactions with each other. The ability to perform physical reasoning and adapt to new environments, while intrinsic to humans, remains challenging to state-of-the-art computational models. In this work, we present a neural model that simultaneously reasons about physics and make future predictions based on visual and dynamics priors. The visual prior predicts a particle-based representation of the system from visual observations. An inference module operates on those particles, predicting and refining estimates of particle locations, object states, and physical parameters, subject to the constraints imposed by the dynamics prior, which we refer to as visual grounding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in environments involving rigid objects, deformable materials, and fluids. Experiments show that our model can infer the physical properties within a few observations, which allows the model to quickly adapt to unseen scenarios and make accurate predictions into the future.</p>

> <p>We consider an agent that is assigned with a temporal logic task in an environment whose semantic representation is only partially known. We represent the semantics of the environment with a set of state properties, called \textit{atomic propositions}. The agent holds a probabilistic belief over the atomic propositions and updates it as new sensory measurements arrive. The goal is to design a policy for the agent that realizes the task with high probability.  We develop a planning strategy that takes the semantic uncertainties into account and by doing so provides probabilistic guarantees on the task success. Furthermore, as new data arrive, the belief over the atomic propositions evolves and, subsequently, the planning strategy adapts accordingly. We evaluate the proposed method on various finite-horizon tasks in planar navigation settings. The empirical results show that the proposed method provides reliable task performance that also improves as the knowledge about the environment enhances.</p>

> <p>We introduce a general approach, called test-time training, for improving the performance of predictive models when training and test data come from different distributions. Test-time training turns a single unlabeled test instance into a self-supervised learning problem, on which we update the model parameters before making a prediction. We show that this simple idea leads to surprising improvements on diverse image classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretical investigations on a convex model reveal helpful intuitions for when we can expect our approach to help.</p>

However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD.</p>

> <p>Recent work suggests that overparameterized autoencoders can be trained to implement associative memory via iterative maps. This phenomenon happens when converged input-output Jacobian of the network has all eigenvalue norms strictly below one. In this work, we theoretically analyze this behavior for sigmoid networks by leveraging recent developments in deep learning theories, especially the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. We find that overparameterized sigmoid autoencoders can have attractors in the NTK limit for both training with a single example and multiple examples under certain conditions. In particular, for multiple training examples, we find that the norm of the largest Jacobian eigenvalue drops below one with increasing input norm, leading to associative memory. </p>

> In reward-poisoning attacks against reinforcement learning (RL), an attacker can perturb the environment reward $r_t$ into $r_t+\delta_t$ at each step, with the goal of forcing the RL agent to learn a nefarious policy.  We categorize such attacks by the infinity-norm constraint on $\delta_t$: We provide a lower threshold below which reward-poisoning attack is infeasible and RL is certified to be safe; we provide a corresponding upper threshold above which the attack is feasible.  Feasible attacks can be further categorized as non-adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends only on $(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1})$, or adaptive where $\delta_t$ depends further on the RL agent&#x27;s learning process at time $t$. Non-adaptive attacks have been the focus of prior works. However, we show that under mild conditions, adaptive attacks can achieve the nefarious policy in steps polynomial in state-space size $|S|$, whereas non-adaptive attacks require exponential steps. We provide a constructive proof that a Fast Adaptive Attack strategy achieves the polynomial rate. Finally, we show that empirically an attacker can find effective reward-poisoning attacks using state-of-the-art deep RL techniques.

> <p>To solve complex tasks, intelligent agents first need to explore their environments. However, providing manual feedback to agents during exploration can be challenging. This work focuses on task-agnostic exploration, where an agent explores a visual environment without yet knowing the tasks it will later be asked to solve. While current methods often learn reactive exploration behaviors to maximize retrospective novelty, we learn a world model trained from images to plan for expected surprise. Novelty is estimated as ensemble disagreement in the latent space of the world model. Exploring and learning the world model without rewards, our approach, latent disagreement (LD), efficiently adapts to a range of control tasks with high-dimensional image inputs.</p>

> <p>In this work we develop a novel Bayesian neural network methodology to achieve strong adversarial robustness without the need for online adversarial training. Unlike previous efforts in this direction, we do not rely solely on the stochasticity of network weights by minimizing the divergence between the learned parameter distribution and a prior. Instead, we additionally require that the model maintain some expected uncertainty with respect to all input covariates. We demonstrate that by encouraging the network to distribute evenly across inputs, the network becomes less susceptible to localized, brittle features which imparts a natural robustness to targeted perturbations. We show empirical robustness on several benchmark datasets.</p>

> <p>Performing controlled experiments on noisy data is essential in understanding deep learning across noise levels. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, previous research has only examined deep learning on controlled synthetic label noise, and real-world label noise has never been studied in the controlled setting. This paper makes three contributions. First, we establish the first benchmark of controlled real label noise (obtained from image search). This new benchmark will enable us to study the image search label noise in a controlled setting for the first time. The second contribution is a simple but highly effective method to overcome both synthetic and real noisy labels. We show that our method achieves the best result on our dataset as well as on two public benchmarks (CIFAR and WebVision). Third, we conduct the largest study by far into understanding deep neural networks trained on noisy labels across different noise levels, noise types, network architectures, methods, and training settings. We will release our data and code on GitHub.</p>

> Adversarial training yields robust models against a specific threat model, e.g., $L_\infty$ adversarial examples. Typically robustness does not generalize to previously unseen threat models, e.g., other $L_p$ norms, or larger perturbations. Our confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) tackles this problem by biasing the model towards low confidence predictions on adversarial examples. By allowing to reject examples with low confidence, robustness generalizes beyond the threat model employed during training. CCAT, trained only on $L_\infty$ adversarial examples, increases robustness against larger $L_\infty$, $L_2$, $L_1$ and $L_0$ attacks, adversarial frames, distal adversarial examples and corrupted examples and yields better clean accuracy compared to adversarial training. For thorough evaluation we developed novel white- and black-box attacks directly attacking CCAT by maximizing confidence. For each threat model, we use $7$ attacks with up to $50$ restarts and $5000$ iterations and report worst-case robust test error, extended to our confidence-thresholded setting, across all attacks.

> The reproducibility debate has caused a renewed interest in changing how one reports uncertainty, from $p$-value for testing a null hypothesis to a confidence interval (CI) for the corresponding parameter. When CIs for multiple selected parameters are being reported, the analog of the false discovery rate (FDR) is the false coverage rate (FCR), which is the expected ratio of number of reported CIs failing to cover their respective parameters to the total number of reported CIs.  Here, we consider the general problem of FCR control in the online setting, where there is an infinite sequence of fixed unknown parameters ordered by time.  While much progress has been made in online testing, a procedure controlling the FDR does not automatically translate to a (nontrivial) procedure that controls the FCR. Therefore, the problem of online FCR control needs to be treated separately.  We propose a novel solution to the problem which only requires the scientist to be able to construct a marginal CI at any given level. If so desired, our framework also yields online FDR control as a special case, or even online sign-classification procedures that control the false sign rate (FSR). Last, all of our methodology applies equally well to prediction intervals, having particular implications for selective conformal inference.

> <p>Online Convex Optimization (OCO) is a powerful framework for sequential prediction, portraying the natural uncertainty inherent in data-streams as though the data were generated by an almost limitless adversary. However, this view, which is often too pessimistic for real-world data, comes with a price. The complexity of solving many important online tasks in this adversarial framework becomes much worse than that of their offline counterparts.</p>  <p>In this work we consider a natural random-order version of the OCO model, in which the adversary can choose the set of loss functions, but does not get to choose the order in which they are supplied to the learner; Instead, they are observed in uniformly random order. While such a model is clearly not suitable for temporal data, which inherently depends on time, it is very much plausible in distributed settings, in which data is generated by multiple independent sources, or streamed without particular order.</p>  <p>Focusing on two important families of online tasks, one which generalizes online linear and logistic regression, and the other being online PCA, we show that under standard well-conditioned-data assumptions (that are often being made in the corresponding offline settings), standard online gradient descent (OGD) methods become much more efficient in the random-order model. In particular, for the first group of tasks which includes linear regression, we show that OGD guarantees polylogarithmic regret (while the only method to achieve comparable regret in the fully-adversarial setting is the Online-Newton Step method which requires quadratic memory and at least quadratic runtime). This result holds even without assuming the convexity of individual loss functions. In the case of online k-PCA, we show that OGD minimizes regret using only a rank-k SVD on each iteration and requires only linear memory (instead of nearly quadratic memory and/or potentially high-rank SVDs required by algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting).</p>

> <p>Entities often interact with each other through multiple types of relations, which are often represented as multilayer networks.  Multilayer networks among the same set of nodes usually share common structures, while each layer can possess its distinct node connecting behaviors. This paper proposes a flexible latent space model for multilayer networks for the purpose of capturing such characteristics. Specifically, the proposed model embeds each node with a latent vector shared among layers and a layer-specific effect for each layer; both elements together with a layer-specific connectivity matrix determine edge formations. To fit the model, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm for efficient parameter estimation.  We also establish theoretical properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and show that the upper bound of the common latent structure's estimation error is inversely proportional to the number of layers under mild conditions. The superior performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through simulation studies and applications to two real-world data examples.  </p>

> <p>Estimation of individual treatment effects is often used as the basis for contextual decision making in fields such as healthcare, education, and economics. However, in many real-world applications it is sufficient for the decision maker to have estimates of upper and lower bounds on the potential outcomes under treatment and non-treatment. In these cases, we can get better finite sample efficiency by estimating simple functions that correctly bound the potential outcomes instead of directly estimating the potential outcomes, which may be complex, and hard to estimate. Our theoretical analysis highlights a tradeoff between the complexity of the learning task and the confidence with which the resulting bounds cover the true potential outcomes. Guided by our theoretical findings, we develop an algorithm for learning upper and lower bounds on the potential outcomes under treatment and non-treatment. Our algorithm finds the optimal bound estimates that maximize an objective function defined by the decision maker without violating a required false coverage rate. We demonstrate our algorithm's performance and highlight how it can be used to guide decision making using a clinical dataset, and a well-known causality benchmark. We show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, providing tighter intervals without violating the required false coverage rate. </p>

> <p>Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are probabilistic graphical models widely used in spatial statistics and related fields to model dependencies over spatial structures. We establish a formal connection between GMRFs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Common GMRFs are special cases of a generative model where the inverse mapping from data to latent variables is given by a 1-layer linear CNN. This connection allows us to generalize GMRFs to multi-layer CNN architectures, effectively increasing the order of the corresponding GMRF in a way which has favorable computational scaling. We describe how well-established tools, such as autodiff and variational inference, can be used for simple and efficient inference and learning of the deep GMRF. We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on a dataset of satellite temperatures, in terms of prediction and predictive uncertainty.</p>

> <p>At the heart of machine learning lies the question of generalizability of learned rules over previously unseen data.  While over-parameterized models based on neural networks are now ubiquitous in machine learning applications, our understanding of their generalization capabilities is incomplete.  This task is made harder by the non-convexity of the underlying learning problems. <br /> We provide a general framework to characterize the asymptotic generalization error for single-layer neural networks (i.e., generalized linear models) with arbitrary non-linearities, making it applicable to regression as well as classification problems.  This framework enables analyzing the effect of (i) over-parameterization and non-linearity during modeling; and (ii) choices of loss function, initialization, and regularizer during learning.  Our model also captures mismatch between training and test distributions.  As examples, we analyze a few special cases, namely linear regression, and logistic regression.  We are also able to rigorously and analytically explain the \emph{double descent} phenomenon in generalized linear models.  </p>

> <p>We propose a new framework, called Poisson learning, for graph based semi-supervised learning at very low label rates. Poisson learning is motivated by the need to address the degeneracy of Laplacian semi-supervised learning at very low label rates. The method replaces the assignment of label values at training points with the placement of sources and sinks, and solves the resulting Poisson equation on the graph. The outcomes are provably more stable and informative than those of Laplacian learning. Poisson learning is fast and efficient to implement, and we present numerical experiments showing the method is superior to other recent approaches to semi-supervised learning at low label rates on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and the WebKb datasets. We also propose a graph-cut version of Poisson learning, called Poisson MBO, that gives higher accuracy and can incorporate prior knowledge of relative class sizes.</p>

> <p>We are interested in how to design reinforcement learning agents that provably reduce the sample complexity for learning new tasks by transferring knowledge from previously-solved ones. The availability of solutions to related problems poses a fundamental trade-off: whether to seek policies that are expected to immediately achieve high (yet sub-optimal) performance in the new task or whether to seek information to quickly identify an optimal solution, potentially at the cost of poor initial behaviour. In this work, we focus on the second objective when the agent has access to a generative model of state-action pairs. First, given a set of solved tasks containing an approximation of the target one, we design an algorithm that quickly identifies an accurate solution by seeking the state-action pairs that are most informative for this purpose. We derive PAC bounds on its sample complexity which clearly demonstrate the benefits of using this kind of prior knowledge. Then, we show how to learn these approximate tasks sequentially by reducing our transfer setting to a hidden Markov model and employing spectral methods to recover its parameters. Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical findings in simple simulated domains.</p>

  Orlando Romero, mouhacine Benosman [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4879-Metadata.json)
> <p>In this paper, we investigate a Lyapunov-like differential inequality that allows us to establish finite-time stability of a continuous-time state-space dynamical system represented via a multivariate ordinary differential equation or differential inclusion. Equipped with this condition, we successfully synthesize first and second-order dynamical systems that achieve finite-time convergence to the minima of a given sufficiently regular cost function. As a byproduct, we show that the p-rescaled gradient flow (p-RGF) proposed by Wibisono et al. (2016) is indeed finite-time convergent, provided the cost function is gradient dominated of order q in (1,p). Thus, we effectively bridge a gap between the p-RGF and the normalized gradient flow (NGF) (p=\infty) proposed by Cortes (2006) in his seminal paper in the context of multi-agent systems. We discuss strategies to discretize our proposed flows and conclude by conducting some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.</p>

> <p>The instability in GANs' training has been a long-standing problem despite remarkable research efforts. We identify that instability issues stem from difficulties of performing feature matching with mini-batch statistics, due to a fragile balance between the fixed target distribution and the progressively generated distribution. In this work, we propose feature quantizatoin (FQ) for the discriminator, to embed both true and fake data samples into a shared discrete space. The quantized values of FQ are constructed as an evolving dictionary, which is consistent with feature statistics of the recent distribution history. Hence, FQ implicitly enables robust feature matching in a compact space.  Our method can be easily plugged into existing GAN models, with little computational overhead in training. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed FQ-GAN can improve the FID scores of baseline methods by a large margin on a variety of tasks, including three representative GAN models on 10 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

> <p>We propose a modeling framework for event data, which excels in small data regime with the ability to incorporate domain knowledge. Our framework will model the intensities of the event starts and ends via a set of first-order temporal logic rules. Using softened representation of temporal relations, and a weighted combination of logic rules, our framework can also deal with uncertainty in event data. Furthermore, many existing point process models can be interpreted as special cases of our framework given simple temporal logic rules. We derive a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for our model, and show that it can lead to accurate predictions when data are sparse and domain knowledge is critical. </p>

> <p>In visual planning (VP), an agent learns to plan goal-directed behavior from observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained from self-supervised robot interaction. Bearing similarity with batch reinforcement learning (RL), VP algorithms essentially combine data-driven perception and planning. Most previous works on VP approached the problem by planning in a learned latent space, resulting in low-quality visual plans, and difficult training algorithms. Here, instead, we propose a simple VP method that plans directly in image space and displays competitive performance. We build on the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method: image samples are treated as nodes in a graph, the graph connectivity is learned from image sequence data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. We make two modifications to SPTM, to make it suitable for VP. First, we propose an energy-based graph connectivity function that admits stable training using contrastive predictive coding. Second, to allow zero-shot planning in new domains, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates images given a context of the domain, and use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph and planning. We show that this simple approach is competitive with SOTA VP methods, in terms of both image fidelity and success rate when using the plan to guide a trajectory-following controller.</p>

> <p>Meta-transfer learning seeks to improve the efficiency of learning a new task via both meta-learning and transfer-learning in a setting with a stream of evolving tasks. While standard attention has been effective in a variety of settings, we question its effectiveness in improving meta-transfer learning since the tasks being learned are dynamic, and the amount of context information can be substantially small. In this paper, using a recently proposed meta-transfer learning model, Sequential Neural Processes (SNP), we first empirically show that it suffers a similar underfitting problem observed in the functions inferred by Neural Processes. However, we further demonstrate that unlike the meta-learning setting, standard attention mechanisms are ineffective in meta-transfer learning.~To resolve, we propose a new attention mechanism, Recurrent Memory Reconstruction (RMR), and demonstrate that providing an imaginary context that is recurrently updated and reconstructed with interaction is crucial in achieving effective attention for meta-transfer learning. Furthermore, incorporating RMR into SNP, we propose Attentive Sequential Neural Processes (ASNP) and demonstrate in various tasks that ASNP significantly outperforms the baselines. </p>

  Minh Hoang, Carleton Kingsford [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4921-Metadata.json)
> <p>Kernel selection for kernel-based methods is prohibitively expensive due to the NP-hard nature of discrete optimization. Since gradient-based optimizers are not applicable due to the lack of a differentiable objective function, many state-of-the-art solutions resort to heuristic search or gradient-free optimization. These approaches, however, require imposing restrictive assumptions on the explorable space of structures such as limiting the active candidate pool, thus depending heavily on the intuition of domain experts. This paper instead proposes \textbf{DTERGENS}, a novel generative search framework that constructs and optimizes a high-performance composite kernel expressions generator. \textbf{DTERGENS} does not restrict the space of candidate kernels and is capable of obtaining flexible length expressions by jointly optimizing a generative termination criterion. We demonstrate that our framework explores more diverse kernels and obtains better performance than state-of-the-art approaches on many real-world predictive tasks.</p>

> <p>Optimizing the parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs), i.e., PDE-constrained optimization (PDE-CO), allows us to model natural systems from observations or perform rational design of structures with complicated mechanical, thermal, or electromagnetic properties.  However, PDE-CO is often computationally prohibitive due to the need to solve the PDE---typically via finite element analysis (FEA)---at each step of the optimization procedure. In this paper we propose amortized finite element analysis (AmorFEA), in which a neural network learns to produce accurate PDE solutions, while preserving many of the advantages of traditional finite element methods. This network is trained to directly minimize the potential energy from which the PDE and finite element method are derived, avoiding the need to generate costly supervised training data by solving PDEs with traditional FEA. As FEA is a variational procedure, AmorFEA is a direct analogue to popular amortized inference approaches in latent variable models, with the finite element basis acting as the variational family. AmorFEA can perform PDE-CO without the need to repeatedly solve the associated PDE, accelerating optimization when compared to a traditional workflow using FEA and the adjoint method.</p>

  Viktor Bengs, Eyke HÃ¼llermeier [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4941-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4941-Supplemental.zip)
> <p>In this paper, we introduce the Preselection Bandit problem, in which the learner preselects a subset of arms (choice alternatives) for a user, which then chooses the final arm from this subset. The learner is not aware of the user's preferences, but can learn them from observed choices. In our concrete setting, we allow these choices to be stochastic and model the user's actions by means of the Plackett-Luce model. The learner's main task is to preselect subsets that eventually lead to highly preferred choices. To formalize this goal, we introduce a reasonable notion of regret and derive lower bounds on the expected regret. Moreover, we propose algorithms for which the upper bound on expected regret matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic term of the time horizon. </p>

> <p>Learning with noisy labels is a common problem in supervised learning. Existing approaches require practitioners to specify \emph{noise rates}, i.e., a set of parameters controlling the severity of label noises in the problem. The specifications are either assumed to be given or estimated using additional approaches. In this work, we introduce a new family of loss functions that we name as \emph{peer loss} functions, which enables learning from noisy labels that does not require a priori specification of the noise rates.Our approach uses a standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework with peer loss functions. Peer loss functions associate each training sample with a certain form of ``peer" samples, which evaluate a classifier' predictions jointly. </p>  <p>We show that, under mild conditions, performing ERM with peer loss functions on the noisy dataset leads to the optimal or a near optimal classifier as if performing ERM over the clean training data, which we do not have access to. We pair our results with an extensive set of experiments, where we compare with state-of-the-art techniques of learning with noisy labels. Our results show that peer loss functions based method consistently outperforms the baseline benchmarks, as well as some recent new results. Peer loss provides a way to simplify model development when facing potentially noisy training labels, and can be promoted as a robust candidate loss function in such situations.</p>

> <p>Rank aggregation from pairwise preferences has widespread applications in recommendation systems and information retrieval. Given the enormous economic and societal impact of these applications, and the consequent incentives for malicious players to manipulate ranking outcomes in their favor, an important challenge is to make rank aggregation algorithms robust to adversarial manipulations in data. In this paper, we initiate the study of robustness in rank aggregation under the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. We consider a setting where pairwise comparisons are initially generated according to a BTL model, but a fraction of these comparisons are corrupted by an adversary prior to being reported to us. We consider a strong contamination model, where an adversary having complete knowledge of the initial truthful data and the underlying true BTL parameters, can subsequently corrupt the truthful data by inserting, deleting, or changing data points. The goal is to estimate the true score/weight of each item under the BTL model, even in the presence of these corruptions. We characterize the extent of adversarial corruption under which the true BTL parameters are uniquely identifiable. We also provide a novel pruning algorithm that provably cleans the data of adversarial corruption under reasonable conditions on data generation and corruption. We corroborate our theory with experiments on synthetic data showing that previous algorithms are vulnerable to even small amounts of corruption, whereas our algorithm can clean a reasonably high amount of corruption.</p>

> <p>Deep learning networks are typically trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods that iteratively improve the model parameters by estimating a gradient on a very small fraction of the training data. A major roadblock faced when increasing the batch size to a substantial fraction of the training data for reducing training time is the persistent degradation in performance (generalization gap). To address this issue, recent work propose to add small perturbations to the model parameters when computing the stochastic gradients and report improved generalization performance due to smoothing effects. However, this approach is poorly understood; it requires often model-specific noise and fine-tuning. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to use instead computationally efficient extrapolation (extragradient) to stabilize the optimization trajectory while still benefiting from smoothing to avoid sharp minima. This principled approach is well grounded from an optimization perspective and we show that a host of variations can be covered in a unified framework that we propose. We prove the convergence of this novel scheme and rigorously evaluate its empirical performance on ResNet, LSTM, and Transformer. We demonstrate that in a variety of experiments the scheme allows scaling to much larger batch sizes than before whilst reaching or surpassing SOTA accuracy.</p>

> <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve the state-of-the-art results on a wide range of image processing tasks, however, the majority of such solutions are problem-specific, like most AI algorithms. The One Network to Solve Them All (OneNet) procedure has been suggested to resolve this issue by exploiting a DNN as the proximal operator in Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solvers for various imaging problems. In this work, we make two contributions, both facilitating end-to-end learning using backpropagation. First, we generalize OneNet to videos by augmenting its convolutional prior network with bidirectional recurrent connections; second, we extend the fixed fully connected linear ADMM data step with another trainable bidirectional convolutional recurrent network. In our computational experiments on the Rotated MNIST, Scanned CIFAR-10 and UCF-101 data sets, the proposed modifications improve performance by a large margin compared to end-to-end convolutional OneNet and 3D Wavelet sparsity on several video processing problems: pixelwise inpainting-denoising, blockwise inpainting, scattered inpainting, super resolution, compressive sensing, deblurring, frame interpolation, frame prediction and colorization. Our two contributions are complementary, and using them together yields the best results.</p>

> <p>The fruit fly Drosophila's olfactory circuit has inspired a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm, FlyHash. In contrast with classical LSH algorithms that produce low dimensional hash codes, FlyHash produces sparse high-dimensional hash codes and has also been shown to have superior empirical performance compared to classical LSH algorithms in similarity search. However, FlyHash uses random projections and cannot learn from data. Building on inspiration from FlyHash and the ubiquity of sparse expansive representations in neurobiology, our work proposes a novel hashing algorithm BioHash that produces sparse high dimensional hash codes in a data-driven manner. We show that BioHash outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing methods. Since our learning algorithm is based on a local and biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule, our work provides evidence for the proposal that LSH might be a computational reason for the abundance of sparse expansive motifs in a variety of biological systems. We also propose a convolutional variant BioConvHash that further improves performance. From the perspective of computer science, BioHash and BioConvHash are fast, scalable and yield compressed binary representations that are useful for similarity search.</p>

> <p>We develop a functional encoder-decoder approach to supervised meta-learning, where labeled data is encoded into an infinite-dimensional functional representation rather than a finite-dimensional one. Furthermore, rather than directly producing the representation, we learn a neural update rule resembling functional gradient descent which iteratively improves the representation. The final representation is used to condition the decoder to make predictions on unlabeled data. Our approach is the first to demonstrates the success of encoder-decoder style meta-learning methods like conditional neural processes on large-scale few-shot classification benchmarks such as miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

> <p>Despite several recent advances in object-oriented generative temporal models, there are a few key challenges. First, while many of these achievements are indispensable for a general world model, it is unclear how we can combine the benefits of each method into a unified model. Second, despite using generative model objectives, abilities for object detection and tracking are mainly investigated, leaving the crucial ability of generation largely under question. Third, a few key abilities for more faithful generation such as multi-modal uncertainty and situated behavior are missing. In this paper, we introduce Generative Structured World Models (G-SWM). The G-SWM not only unifies the key properties of previous models in a principled framework but also achieves two crucial new abilities, multi-modal uncertainty and situated behavior. By investigating the generation ability in comparison to the previous models, we demonstrate that G-SWM achieves the best or comparable performance for all experiment settings including a few complex settings that have not been tested before.</p>

> Single-objective black box optimization (also known as zeroth-order optimization) is the process of minimizing a scalar objective $f(x)$, given evaluations at adaptively chosen inputs $x$. In this paper, we consider multi-objective optimization, where $f(x)$ outputs a vector of possibly competing objectives and the goal is to converge to the Pareto frontier. Quantitatively, we wish to maximize the standard \emph{hypervolume indicator} metric, which measures the dominated hypervolume of the entire set of chosen inputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel scalarization function, which we term the \emph{hypervolume scalarization}, and show that drawing random scalarizations from an appropriately chosen distribution can be used to efficiently approximate the \emph{hypervolume indicator} metric. We utilize this connection to show that Bayesian optimization with our scalarization via common acquisition functions, such as Thompson Sampling or Upper Confidence Bound, provably converges to the whole Pareto frontier by deriving tight \emph{hypervolume regret} bounds on the order of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, we highlight the general utility of our scalarization framework by showing that any provably convergent single-objective optimization process can be converted to a multi-objective optimization process with provable convergence guarantees.

> <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a widely used framework for learning generative models. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), one of the most successful variants of GANs, require solving a minmax optimization problem to global optimality, but are in practice successfully trained using stochastic gradient descent-ascent. In this paper, we show that, when the generator is a one-layer network, stochastic gradient descent-ascent converges to a global solution with polynomial time and sample complexity.</p>

> <p>We present an approach for unsupervised domain adaptation---with a strong focus on practical considerations of within-domain class imbalance and between-domain class distribution shift---from a class-conditioned domain alignment perspective. Current methods for class-conditioned domain alignment aim to explicitly minimize a loss function based on pseudo-label estimations of the target domain. However, these methods suffer from pseudo-label bias in the form of error accumulation. We propose a method that removes the need for explicit optimization of model parameters from pseudo-labels directly. Instead, we present a sampling-based implicit alignment approach where the sample selection procedure is implicitly guided by the pseudo-labels. Theoretical analysis shows that implicit alignment facilitates adversarial domain-invariant representation learning. Empirical results and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, our method exhibits superior robustness in the presence of extreme within-domain class imbalance and between-domain class distribution shift.</p>

> We study the link between generalization and interference in temporal-difference (TD) learning. Interference is defined as the inner product of two different gradients, representing their alignment; this quantity emerges as being of interest from a variety of observations about neural networks, parameter sharing and the dynamics of learning. We find that TD easily leads to low-interference, under-generalizing parameters, while the effect seems reversed in supervised learning. We hypothesize that the cause can be traced back to the interplay between the dynamics of interference and bootstrapping. This is supported empirically by several observations: the negative relationship between the generalization gap and interference in TD, the negative effect of bootstrapping on interference and the local coherence of targets, and the contrast between the propagation rate of information in TD(0) versus TD($\lambda$) and regression tasks such as Monte-Carlo policy evaluation. We hope that these new findings can guide the future discovery of better bootstrapping methods.

> <p>Learning to control complex bodies and reuse learned behaviors is a longstanding challenge in continuous control. We study the problem of learning reusable humanoid skills by imitating motion capture data and co-training with complementary tasks. We show that it is possible to learn reusable skills through reinforcement learning on 50 times more motion capture data than prior work. We systematically compare a variety of different network architectures across different data regimes both in terms of imitation performance as well as transfer to challenging locomotion tasks. Finally we show that it is possible to interleave the motion capture tracking with training on complementary tasks, enriching the resulting skill space, and enabling the reuse of skills not well covered by the motion capture data such as getting up from the ground or catching a ball.</p>

> <p>The high sample complexity of reinforcement learning challenges its use in practice. A promising approach is to quickly adapt pre-trained policies to new environments. Existing methods for this policy adaptation problem typically rely on domain randomization and meta-learning, by sampling from some distribution of target environments during pre-training, and thus face difficulty on out-of-distribution target environments. We propose new model-based mechanisms that are able to make online adaptation in unseen target environments, by combining ideas from no-regret online learning and adaptive control. We prove that the approach learns policies in the target environment that can quickly recover trajectories from the source environment, and establish the rate of convergence in general settings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach for policy adaptation in a diverse set of continuous control tasks, achieving the performance of state-of-the-art methods with much lower sample complexity. </p>

> <p>The performance of optimizers, particularly in deep learning, depends considerably on their chosen hyperparameter configuration. The efficacy of optimizers is often studied under near-optimal problem-specific hyperparameters, and finding these settings may be prohibitively costly for practitioners. In this work, we argue that a fair assessment of optimizers' performance must take the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning into account, i.e., how easy it is to find good hyperparameter configurations using an automatic hyperparameter search. Evaluating a variety of optimizers on an extensive set of standard datasets and architectures, our results indicate that Adam is the most practical solution, particularly in low-budget scenarios.</p>

> <p>Most algorithms for solving optimization problems or finding saddle points of convex-concave functions are fixed point algorithms. In this work we consider the generic problem of finding a fixed point of an average of operators, or an approximation thereof, in a distributed setting. Our work is motivated by the needs of federated learning. In this context, each local operator models the computations done locally on a mobile device. We investigate two strategies to achieve such a consensus: one  based on a fixed number of  local steps, and the other based on randomized  computations. In both cases, the goal is to limit communication of the locally-computed variables, which is often the bottleneck in distributed frameworks. We perform convergence analysis of both methods and conduct a number of experiments highlighting the benefits of our approach.</p>

> <p>Meta-learning algorithms produce feature extractors which achieve state-of-the-art performance on few-shot classification.  While the literature is rich with meta-learning methods, little is known about why the resulting feature extractors perform so well.  We develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of meta-learning and the difference between models trained using meta-learning and models which are trained classically.  In doing so, we develop several hypotheses for why meta-learned models perform better.  In addition to visualizations, we design several regularizers inspired by our hypotheses which improve performance on few-shot classification.</p>

  Felix Xinnan Yu, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Menon, Sanjiv Kumar [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5034-Metadata.json)
> <p>We consider learning a multi-class classification model in the federated setting, where each user has access to the positive data associated with only a single class. As a result, during each federated learning round, the users need to locally update the classifier without having access to the features and the model parameters for the negative labels. Since the loss function at a user is independent of the negative labels, naively employing conventional decentralized learning such as the distributed SGD or Federated Averaging may lead to trivial or extremely poor classifiers. In particular, for the embedding based classifiers, all the class embeddings might collapse to a single point.</p>  <p>To address this problem, we propose a generic framework for training with only positive labels, namely Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS), where the server imposes a geometric regularizer after each round to encourage classes spread out in the embedding space. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that FedAwS can almost match the performance of conventional learning where users have access to negative labels. We further extend the proposed method to the settings with large output spaces, such as the extreme multi-class classification. </p>

> <p>Latent confounders---unobserved variables that influence both treatment and outcome---can bias estimates of causal effects. In some cases, these confounders are shared across observations, e.g. all students in a school are influenced by the school's culture in addition to any educational interventions they receive individually. This paper shows how to model latent confounders that have this structure and thereby improve estimates of causal effects. The key innovations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaussian processes with structured latent confounders (GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm for this model based on elliptical slice sampling. GP-SLC provides principled Bayesian uncertainty estimates of individual treatment effect without requiring parametric assumptions about the functional forms relating confounders, covariates, treatment, and outcomes. This paper also proves that, for linear functional forms, accounting for the structure in latent confounders is sufficient for asymptotically consistent estimates of causal effect. Finally, this paper shows GP-SLC is competitive with or more accurate than widely used causal inference techniques such as multi-level linear models and Bayesian additive regression trees. Benchmark datasets include the Infant Health and Development Program and a dataset showing the effect of changing temperatures on state-wide energy consumption across New England.</p>

> <p>We introduce T-Basis, a novel concept for a compact representation of a set of tensors, each of an arbitrary shape, which is often seen in Neural Networks. Each of the tensors in the set is modelled using Tensor Rings, though the concept is applicable to other Tensor Networks as well. Owing its name to the T-shape of nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with the size of each tensor in the set, and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis. We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression, and demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed networks, and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for training and inference in resource-constrained environments, as well as usage on the edge devices.</p>

> <p>We propose a method for multiple hypothesis testing with familywise error rate (FWER) control, called the i-FWER test. Most testing methods are predefined algorithms that do not allow modifications after observing the data. However, in practice, analysts tend to choose a promising algorithm after observing the data; unfortunately, this violates the validity of the conclusion. The i-FWER test allows much flexibility: a human (or a computer program acting on the human's behalf) may adaptively guide the algorithm in a data-dependent manner. We prove that our test controls FWER if the analysts adhere to a particular protocol of âmaskingâ and âunmaskingâ. We demonstrate via numerical experiments the power of our test under structured non-nulls, and then explore new forms of masking.</p>

> <p>Training multiple tasks jointly in one deep network yields reduced latency during inference and better performance over the single-task counterpart by sharing certain layers of a network. However, over-sharing a network could erroneously enforce over-generalization, causing negative knowledge transfer across tasks. Prior works rely on human intuition or pre-computed task relatedness scores for ad hoc branching structures. They provide sub-optimal end results and often require huge efforts for the trial-and-error process.</p>  <p>In this work, we present an automated multi-task learning algorithm that learns where to share or branch within a network, designing an effective network topology that is directly optimized for multiple objectives across tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel tree-structured design space that casts a tree branching operation as a gumbel-softmax sampling procedure. This enables differentiable network splitting that is end-to-end trainable. We validate the proposed method on controlled synthetic data, CelebA, and Taskonomy. </p>

> <p>Structured stochastic processes evolving in continuous time present a widely adopted framework to model phenomena occurring in nature and engineering. However, such models are often chosen to satisfy the Markov property to maintain tractability. One of the more popular of such memoryless models is Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs). In this work, we lift its restriction to exponential survival times to arbitrary distributions. Current extensions achieve this via auxiliary states, which hinder tractability. To avoid that, we introduce a set of node-wise clocks to construct a collection of graph-coupled semi-Markov chains. We provide algorithms for parameter and structure inference, which make use of local dependencies and conduct experiments on synthetic data and data-sets generated through a benchmark tool for gene regulatory networks. In doing so, we point out advantages compared to current CTBN extensions.</p>

> <p>Recently non-convex optimization approaches for solving machine learning problems have gained significant attention.

> <p>Efficient construction of checkpoints/snapshots is a critical tool for training and diagnosing deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a lossy compression scheme for checkpoint constructions (called LC-Checkpoint). LC-Checkpoint simultaneously maximizes the compression rate and optimizes the recovery speed, under the assumption that SGD is used to train the model. LC-Checkpoint uses quantization and priority promotion to store the most crucial information for SGD to recover, and then uses a Huffman coding to leverage the non-uniform distribution of the gradient scales. Our extensive experiments show that LC-Checkpoint achieves a compression rate up to 28Ã and recovery speedup up to 5.77Ã over a state-of-the-art algorithm (SCAR).</p>

> Feature selection problems have been extensively studied in the setting of linear estimation, for instance LASSO, but less emphasis has been placed on feature selection for neural networks.  In this study, we propose a method for feature selection in non-linear function estimation problems. The new procedure is based on directly penalizing the $\ell_0$ norm of features, or the count of the number of selected features. Our $\ell_0$ based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution, which allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli distributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework simultaneously learns a non-linear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justification for incorporating Bernoulli distribution for feature selection. Furthermore, we evaluate our method using synthetic and real-life data and demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used methods in terms of predictive performance and feature selection.

> <p>Training neural ODEs on large datasets has not been tractable due to the necessity of allowing the adaptive numerical ODE solver to refine its step size to very small values. In practice this leads to dynamics equivalent to many hundreds or even thousands of layers. In this paper, we overcome this apparent difficulty by introducing a theoretically-grounded combination of both optimal transport and stability regularizations which encourage neural ODEs to prefer simpler dynamics out of all the dynamics that solve a problem well. Simpler dynamics lead to faster convergence and to fewer discretizations of the solver, considerably decreasing wall-clock time without loss in performance. Our approach allows us to train neural ODE-based generative models to the same performance as the unregularized dynamics, with significant reductions in training time. This brings neural ODEs closer to practical relevance in large-scale applications.</p>

> <p>Deep generative models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Despite this progress, quantitative evaluation and comparison of generative models remains as one of the important challenges. One of the most popular metrics for evaluating generative models is the log-likelihood. While the direct computation of log-likelihood can be intractable, it has been recently shown that the log-likelihood of some of the most interesting generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAE) or generative adversarial networks (GAN) can be efficiently estimated using annealed importance sampling (AIS). In this work, we argue that the log-likelihood metric by itself cannot represent all the different performance characteristics of generative models, and propose to use rate distortion curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models. We show that we can approximate the entire rate distortion curve using one single run of AIS for roughly the same computational cost as a single log-likelihood estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of different deep generative models such as VAEs, GANs (and its variants) and adversarial autoencoders (AAE) on MNIST and CIFAR10, and arrive at a number of insights not obtainable from log-likelihoods alone.</p>

> <p>This paper studies the problem of post-hoc calibration of machine learning classifiers. We introduce the following desiderata for uncertainty calibration: (a) accuracy-preserving, (b) data-efficient, and (c) high expressive power. We show that none of the existing methods satisfy all three requirements, and demonstrate how Mix-n-Match calibration strategies (i.e., ensemble and composition) can help achieve remarkably better data-efficiency and expressive power while provably preserving classification accuracy of the original classifier. We also show that existing calibration error estimators (e.g., histogram-based ECE) are unreliable especially in small-data regime. Therefore, we propose an alternative data-efficient kernel density-based estimator for a reliable evaluation of the calibration performance and prove its asymptotically unbiasedness and consistency.</p>

> <p>Training machine learning models to be robust against adversarial inputs poses seemingly insurmountable challenges. To better understand model robustness, we consider the underlying problem of learning robust representations. We develop a general definition of representation vulnerability that captures the maximum change of mutual information between the input and output distributions, under the worst-case input distribution perturbation. We prove a theorem that establishes a lower bound on the minimum adversarial risk that can be achieved for any downstream classifier based on this definition. We then propose an unsupervised learning method for obtaining intrinsically robust representations by maximizing the worst-case mutual information between input and output distributions. Experiments on downstream classification tasks and analyses of saliency maps support the robustness of the representations found using unsupervised learning with our training principle. </p>

> <p>Monte-Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving sequential games that are too large for full tree traversals. It works by using gradient estimates that can be computed via sampling. However, stochastic methods for sequential games have not been investigated extensively beyond MCCFR. In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm, coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly-stronger theoretical guarantees on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential games. We show extensive experiments on three games, where some variants of our methods outperform MCCFR.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we propose a bootstrap method applied to massive data processed distributedly in a large number of machines. This new method is computationally efficient in that we bootstrap on the master machine without over-resampling, typically required by existing methods \cite{kleiner2014scalable,sengupta2016subsampled}, while provably achieving optimal statistical efficiency with minimal communication. Our method does not require repeatedly re-fitting the model but only applies multiplier bootstrap in the master machine on the gradients received from the worker machines. Simulations validate our theory.</p>

> <p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a prevailing NAS solution to identify architectures. Based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture space, DARTS learns a differentiable architecture weight and largely reduces the search cost. However, its stability and generalizability have been challenged for yielding deteriorating architectures as the search proceeds. We find that the precipitous validation loss landscape, which leads to a dramatic performance drop when distilling the final architecture, is an essential factor that causes instability. Based on this observation, we propose a perturbation-based regularization, named SmoothDARTS (SDARTS), to smooth the loss landscape and improve the generalizability of DARTS. In particular, our new formulations stabilize DARTS by either random smoothing or adversarial attack. The search trajectory on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and due to the improved stability, we achieve performance gain across various search spaces on 4 datasets. Furthermore, we mathematically show that SDARTS implicitly regularizes the Hessian norm of the validation loss, which accounts for a smoother loss landscape and improved performance.</p>

> The Frank-Wolfe algorithm has become a popular first-order optimization algorithm for it is simple and projection-free, and it has been successfully applied to a variety of real-world problems. Its main drawback however lies in its convergence rate, which can be excessively slow due to naive descent directions. We propose to speed up the Frank-Wolfe algorithm by better aligning the descent direction with that of the negative gradient via a subroutine. This subroutine chases the negative gradient direction in a matching pursuit-style while still preserving the projection-free property. Although the approach is reasonably natural, it produces very significant results. We derive convergence rates $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\omega t})$ of our method and we demonstrate its competitive advantage both per iteration and in CPU time over the state-of-the-art in a series of computational experiments.

> We show new connections between adversarial learning and explainability for deep neural networks (DNNs). One form of explanation of the output of a neural network model in terms of its input features, is a vector of feature-attributions, which can be generated by various techniques such as Integrated Gradients (IG), DeepSHAP, LIME, and CXPlain. Two desirable characteristics of an attribution-based explanation are: (1) \textit{sparseness}: the attributions of irrelevant or weakly relevant features should be negligible, thus resulting in \textit{concise} explanations in terms of the significant features, and (2) \textit{stability}: it should not vary significantly within a small local neighborhood of the input. Our first contribution is a theoretical exploration of how these two properties (when using IG-based attributions) are related to adversarial training, for a class of 1-layer networks (which includes logistic regression models for binary and multi-class classification); for these networks we show that (a) adversarial training using an $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversary produces models with sparse attribution vectors, and (b) natural model-training while encouraging stable explanations (via an extra term in the loss function), is equivalent to adversarial training.  Our second contribution is an empirical verification of phenomenon (a), which we show, somewhat surprisingly, occurs \textit{not only in 1-layer networks, but also DNNs trained on standard image datasets}, and extends beyond IG-based attributions,  to those based on DeepSHAP:  adversarial training with $\linf$-bounded perturbations yields significantly sparser attribution vectors, with little degradation in performance on natural test data, compared to natural training. Moreover, the sparseness of the attribution vectors is significantly better than that achievable via $\ell_1$-regularized natural training.

> <p>Boosting is a technique that boosts a weak and inaccurate machine learning algorithm into a strong accurate learning algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm by Freund and Schapire (for which they were awarded the G{\"o}del prize in 2003) is one of the widely used boosting algorithms, with many applications in theory and practice. Suppose we have a gamma-weak learner for a Boolean concept class C that takes time R(C), then the time complexity of AdaBoost scales as VC(C)poly(R(C), 1/gamma), where VC(C) is the VC-dimension of C. In this paper, we show how quantum techniques can improve the time complexity of classical AdaBoost. To this end, suppose we have a gamma-weak quantum learning algorithm for a Boolean concept class C that takes time Q(C), we introduce a quantum boosting algorithm whose complexity scales as sqrt{VC(C)}poly(Q(C),1/gamma); thereby achieving quadratic quantum improvement over classical AdaBoost in terms of Â VC(C).Â </p>

> <p>Recent advances in deep learning theory have evoked the study of generalizability across different local minima of deep neural networks (DNNs). While current work focused on either discovering properties of good local minima or developing regularization techniques to induce good local minima, no approach exists that can tackle both problems. We achieve these two goals successfully in a unified manner. Specifically, based on the observed Fisher information we propose a metric both strongly indicative of generalizability of local minima and effectively applied as a practical regularizer. We provide theoretical analysis including a generalization bound and empirically demonstrate the success of our approach in both capturing and improving the generalizability of DNNs. Experiments are performed on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for various network architectures.</p>

> <p>A fundamental task in kernel methods is to pick nodes and weights, so as to approximate a given function from an RKHS by the weighted sum of kernel translates located at the nodes. This is the crux of kernel density estimation, kernel quadrature, or interpolation from discrete samples. Furthermore, RKHSs offer a convenient mathematical and computational framework. We introduce and analyse continuous volume sampling (VS), the continuous counterpart -for choosing node locations- of a discrete distribution introduced in (Deshpande &amp; Vempala, 2006). Our contribution is theoretical: we prove almost optimal bounds for interpolation and quadrature under VS. While similar bounds already exist for some specific RKHSs using ad-hoc node constructions, VS offers bounds that apply to any Mercer kernel and depend on the spectrum of the associated integration operator. We emphasize that, unlike previous randomized approaches that rely on regularized leverage scores or determinantal point processes, evaluating the pdf of VS only requires pointwise evaluations of the kernel. VS is thus naturally amenable to MCMC samplers.</p>

> <p>The trace regression model, a direct extension to the well-studied linear regression model, allows one to map matrices to real-valued outputs. We here introduce a yet more general model, namely the partial trace regression model, a family of linear mappings from matrix-valued inputs to matrix-valued outputs; this model subsumes the trace regression model and thus the linear regression model. Borrowing tools from quantum information theory, where partial trace operators have been extensively studied, we propose a framework for learning partial trace regression models from data by taking advantage of the so-called low-rank Kraus representation of completely positive maps. We show the relevance of our framework with synthetic and real-world experiments conducted for both i) matrix-to-matrix regression and ii) positive semidefinite matrix completion, two tasks which can be formulated as partial trace regression problems.</p>

> <p>Interest has been rising lately towards methods representing data in non-Euclidean spaces (e.g. hyperbolic or elliptical)  that provide specific inductive biases useful for certain real-world data properties, e.g. scale-free, hierarchical or cyclical. However, the popular graph neural networks are currently limited in modeling data only via Euclidean geometry and associated vector space operations. Here, we bridge this gap by proposing mathematically grounded generalizations of graph convolutional networks (GCN) to (products of) constant curvature spaces. We do this by i) introducing a unified gyrovector space formalism that can interpolate smoothly between all geometries of constant curvature irrespective of their sign, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric coordinates that generalize the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass. Our class of models smoothly recover their Euclidean counterparts when the curvature goes to zero from either side. Empirically, we outperform Euclidean GCNs in the tasks of node classification and distortion minimization for symbolic data exhibiting non-Euclidean behavior, according to their discrete curvature.</p>

> <p>Generative autoencoders offer a promising approach for controllable text generation by leveraging their learned sentence representations. However, current models struggle to maintain coherent latent spaces required to perform meaningful text manipulations via latent vector operations. Specifically, we demonstrate by example that neural encoders do not necessarily map similar sentences to nearby latent vectors. A theoretical explanation for this phenomenon establishes that high-capacity autoencoders can learn an arbitrary mapping between sequences and associated latent representations. To remedy this issue, we augment adversarial autoencoders with a denoising objective where original sentences are reconstructed from perturbed  versions (referred as DAAE). We prove that this simple modification guides the latent space geometry of the resulting model by encouraging the encoder to map similar texts to similar latent representations. In empirical comparisons with various types of autoencoders, our model provides the best trade-off between generation quality and reconstruction capacity. Moreover, the improved geometry of the DAAE latent space enables \emph{zero-shot} text style transfer via simple latent vector arithmetic.\footnote{Our code will be publicly released after the review process.}</p>

> <p>We propose to study the generalization error of a learned predictor h^ in terms of that of a surrogate (potentially randomized) classifier that is coupled to h^ and designed to trade empirical risk for control of generalization error. In the case where h^ interpolates the data, it is interesting to consider theoretical surrogate classifiers that are partially derandomized or rerandomized, e.g., fit to the training data but with modified label noise. We show that replacing h^ by its conditional distribution with respect to an arbitrary sigma-field is a viable method to derandomize. We give an example, inspired by the work of Nagarajan and Kolter (2019), where the learned classifier h^ interpolates the training data with high probability, has small risk, and, yet, does not belong to a nonrandom class with a tight uniform bound on two-sided generalization error. At the same time, we bound the risk of h^ in terms of a surrogate that is constructed by conditioning and shown to belong to a nonrandom class with uniformly small generalization error. </p>

> <p>The dominant paradigm for relation prediction in knowledge graphs involves learning and operating on latent representations (i.e., embeddings) of entities and relations. However, these embedding-based methods do not explicitly capture the compositional logical rules underlying the knowledge graph,  and they are limited to the transductive setting,  where the full set of entities must be known during training. Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation prediction framework,  GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and has a strong inductive bias to learn entity-independent relational semantics.  Unlike embedding-based models, GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize to unseen entities and graphs after training. We provide theoretical proof and strong empirical evidence that GraIL can rep-resent a useful subset of first-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms existing rule-induction baselines in the inductive setting. We also demonstrate significant gains obtained by ensembling GraIL with various knowledge graph embedding methods in the transductive setting, highlighting the complementary inductive bias of our method.</p>

> We consider the problem of online control in a known linear dynamical system subject to adversarial noise. Existing regret bounds for this setting scale as $\sqrt{T}$ unless strong stochastic assumptions are imposed on the noise. We give the first algorithm with logarithmic regret for arbitrary adversarial noise sequences, provided that the state and control costs are given by fixed quadratic functions. We propose a novel analysis that combines a new variant of the performance difference lemma with techniques from optimal control, allowing us to reduce online control to online prediction with delayed feedback. Unlike prior work, which leverages the so-called online convex optimization with memory framework, our analysis \emph{does not} need to bound movement costs of the iterates, leading to logarithmic regret. Our performance difference lemma-based analysis may be of broader interest beyond linear control.

> <p>Efficient and interpretable spatial analysis is crucial in many fields such as geology, sports, and climate science. Large-scale spatial data often contains complex higher-order correlations across features and locations. While tensor latent factor models can describe higher-order correlations, they are inherently computationally expensive to train. Furthermore, for spatial analysis, these models should not only be predictive but also be spatially coherent. However, latent factor models are sensitive to initialization and can yield inexplicable results. We develop a novel Multiresolution Tensor Learning (MRTL) algorithm for efficiently learning interpretable spatial patterns. MRTL initializes the latent factors from an approximate full-rank tensor model for improved interpretability and progressively learns from a coarse resolution to the fine resolution for an enormous computation speedup. We also prove the theoretical convergence and computational complexity of MRTL. When applied to two real-world datasets, MRTL demonstrates 4 ~ 5 times speedup compared to a fixed resolution while yielding accurate and interpretable models.</p>

> <p>Traditionally, online algorithms optimize the worst-case competitive ratio between the algorithm and the optimal solution. To overcome the inherent pessimism of worst-case analysis, a popular line of recent research incorporates ML advice in the design of online algorithms to improve their performance in typical instances. These papers treat the ML algorithm as a black-box, and redesign online algorithms to take advantage of ML predictions. In this paper, we ask the complementary question: can we redesign ML algorithms to provide better predictions for online algorithms? We explore this question in the context of the classic rent-or-buy problem, and show that incorporating optimization benchmarks directly in ML loss functions leads to significantly better performance. We support this finding both through theoretical bounds and numerical simulations, and posit that ``learning for optimization'' is a fertile area for future research.</p>

> <p>What goals should a multi-goal reinforcement learning agent pursue during training in long-horizon tasks? When the desired (test time) goal distribution is too distant to offer a useful learning signal, we argue that the agent should not pursue unobtainable goals. Instead, it should set its own intrinsic goals that maximize the entropy of the historical achieved goal distribution. We propose to optimize this objective by having the agent pursue past achieved goals in sparsely explored areas of the goal space, which focuses exploration on the frontier of the achievable goal set. We show that our strategy achieves an order of magnitude better sample efficiency than the prior state of the art on long-horizon multi-goal tasks including maze navigation and block stacking. </p>

> <p>Stochastic optimization algorithms have become indispensable in machine learning. An unresolved foundational question in this area is the difference between with-replacement sampling and without-replacement sampling --- does the latter have superior convergence rate compared to the former? A groundbreaking result of Recht and Re reduces the problem to a noncommutative analogue of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality where positive numbers are replaced by n positive definite matrices. If this inequality holds for all n, then without-replacement sampling indeed outperforms with-replacement sampling. The conjectured Recht--Re inequality has so far only been established for n = 2 and a special case of n = 3. We will show that the Recht--Re conjecture is false for general n. Our approach relies on the noncommutative positivstellensatz, which allows us to reduce the conjectured inequality to a semidefinite program and the validity of the conjecture to certain bounds for the optimum values, which we show are false as soon as n = 5.</p>

> <p>Prediction problems often admit competing models that perform almost equally well. This effect â called the multiplicity of good models â challenges how we build and deploy predictive models. In this paper, we study a specific notion of model multiplicity â predictive multiplicity â where competing models assign conflicting predictions. Predictive multiplicity signals irreconcilable differences in the predictions of competing models. In applications such as recidivism prediction and credit scoring, evidence of predictive multiplicity challenges model selection and downstream processes that depend on it. We propose measures to evaluate the severity of predictive multiplicity in classification, and develop integer programming methods to compute them efficiently. We apply our methods to evaluate predictive multiplicity in recidivism prediction problems. Our results show that real-world datasets may admit competing models that assign wildly conflicting predictions, and support the need to measure and report predictive multiplicity in model development.</p>

> <p>We propose a direct-to-word sequence model which uses a word network to learn word embeddings from letters. The word network can be integrated seamlessly with arbitrary sequence models including Connectionist Temporal Classification and encoder-decoder models with attention. We show our direct-to-word model can achieve word error rate gains over sub-word level models for speech recognition. We also show that our direct-to-word approach retains the ability to predict words not seen at training time without any retraining. Finally, we demonstrate that a word-level model can use a larger stride than a sub-word level model while maintaining accuracy. This makes the model more efficient both for training and inference.</p>

> <p>Temporal difference (TD) learning is one of the main foundations of modern reinforcement learning. This paper studies the use of TD(0) to estimate the value function of a given \textit{evaluation} policy from a batch of data. In this batch setting, we show that TD(0) may converge to an inaccurate value function because the update following an action is weighted according to the number of times that action occurred in the batch -- not the true probability of the action under the evaluation policy. To address this limitation, we introduce \textit{policy sampling error corrected}-TD(0) (PSEC-TD(0)). PSEC-TD(0) first estimates the empirical distribution of actions in each state in the batch and then uses importance sampling to correct for the mismatch between the empirical weighting and the correct weighting for updates following each action. We refine the concept of a certainty-equivalence estimate and argue that PSEC-TD(0) converges to a more desirable fixed-point than TD(0) for a fixed batch of data. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of PSEC-TD(0) on two batch value function learning tasks and show that PSEC-TD(0) produces value function estimates with lower mean squared error than the standard TD(0) algorithm in both discrete and continuous control tasks.</p>

> We consider the problem of allocating a fixed budget of samples to a finite set of discrete distributions to learn them uniformly well (minimizing the maximum error) in terms of four common distance measures: $\ell_2^2$, $\ell_1$, $f$-divergence, and separation distance. To present a unified treatment of these distances, we first propose a general \emph{optimistic tracking algorithm} and analyze its sample allocation performance w.r.t.~an oracle. We then instantiate this algorithm for the four distance measures and derive bounds on their regret. We also show that the allocation performance of the proposed algorithm cannot, in general, be improved, by deriving lower-bounds on the expected deviation from the oracle allocation for any adaptive scheme. We verify our theoretical findings through some experiments. Finally, we show that the techniques developed in the paper can be easily extended to learn some classes of continuous distributions as well as to the related setting of minimizing the average error (in terms of the four distances) in learning a set of distributions.

> <p>Large neural models have demonstrated human-level performance on language and vision benchmarks such as ImageNet and Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI). Yet, their performance degrades considerably when tested on adversarial or out-of-distribution samples. This raises the question of whether these models have learned to solve a dataset rather than the underlying task by overfitting on spurious dataset biases. </p>  <p>We investigate one recently proposed approach, AFLite, which adversarially filters such dataset biases, as a means to mitigate the prevalent overestimation of machine performance. We provide a theoretical understanding for AFLite, by situating it in the generalized framework for optimum bias reduction. Our experiments show that as a result of the substantial reduction of these biases, models trained on the filtered datasets yield better generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, especially when the benchmarks used for training are over-populated with biased samples. We show that AFLite is broadly applicable to a variety of both real and synthetic datasets for reduction of measurable dataset biases and provide extensive supporting analyses. Finally, filtering results in a large drop in model performance (e.g., from 92% to 62% for SNLI), while human performance still remains high. Our work thus shows that such filtered datasets can pose new research challenges for robust generalization by serving as upgraded benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are approximate posterior inference algorithms that are often said to have complementary strengths, with VI being fast but biased and MCMC being slower but asymptotically unbiased. In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to an VI procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. The evolution under gradient descent of real-world VI approximations that use tractable, parametric flows can thus be seen as an approximation to the evolution of a population of LD-MCMC chains. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to the Markov chain not having burned in) may track that of VI (due to the optimizer not having converged), up to differences due to VIâs asymptotic bias and parameter geometry. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and their momentum-accelerated counterparts) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it is stopped before fully burning in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).</p>

> <p>Graph embeddings are a ubiquitous tool for machine learning tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, on graph-structured data. However, computing the embeddings for large-scale graphs is prohibitively inefficient even if we are interested only in a small subset of relevant vertices. To address this, we present an efficient graph coarsening approach, based on Schur complements, for computing the embedding of the relevant vertices. We prove that these embeddings are preserved exactly by the Schur complement graph that is obtained via Gaussian elimination on the non-relevant vertices. As computing Schur complements is expensive, we give a nearly-linear time algorithm that generates a coarsened graph on the relevant vertices that provably matches the Schur complement in expectation. Our experiments involving prediction tasks on graphs demonstrate that computing embeddings on the coarsened graph, rather than the entire graph, leads to significant time savings without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

> <p>Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) hasbeen broadly applied to the problem of identi-fying smooth, low-dimensional temporal struc-ture underlying large-scale neural recordings.However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, whichmotivates combining GPFA with discrete ob-servation models for binned spike count data.The drawback to this approach is that GPFApriors are not conjugate to count model like-lihoods, which makes inference challenging.Here we address this obstacle by introduc-ing a fast, approximate inference method fornon-conjugate GPFA models. Our approachuses orthogonal second-order polynomials toapproximate the nonlinear terms in the non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a methodwe refer to aspolynomial approximate log-likelihood(PAL) estimators. This approxima-tion allows for accurate closed-form evalua-tion of marginal likelihoods and fast numericaloptimization for parameters and hyperparam-eters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFAmodels with binomial, Poisson, and negativebinomial observations. We find the PAL esti-mation achieves faster convergence times andhigh accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art inference methods. We also find thatPAL hyperparameters can provide sensible ini-tialization for black box variational inference(BBVI), which will improve BBVI accuracy.We apply these methods to data from mousevisual cortex and primate higher-order visualand parietal cortices.

> <p>We introduce a radical new approach to endowing neural networks with access to long-term and large-scale memory.  Architecting networks with internal multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe that coherent memory subsystems emerge as a result of training.  Our design both drastically differs from and is far simpler than prior efforts, such as the recently proposed Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), which uses intricately crafted controllers to connect neural networks to external memory banks.  Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories.  Our multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully connected networks.  Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner.  We demonstrate these capabilities on synthetic exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps, outperforming the DNC. On tasks without any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of safe adaptation: given a model trained on a variety of past experiences for some task, can this model learn to perform that task in a new situation while avoiding catastrophic failure? This problem setting occurs frequently in real-world reinforcement learning scenarios such as a vehicle adapting to drive in a new city, or a robotic drone adapting a policy trained only in simulation. While learning without catastrophic failures is exceptionally difficult, prior experience can allow us to learn models that make this much easier. These models might not directly transfer to new settings, but can enable cautious adaptation that is substantially safer than na\"{i}ve adaptation as well as learning from scratch. Building on this intuition, we propose risk-averse domain adaptation (RADA). RADA works in two steps: it first trains probabilistic model-based RL agents in a population of source domains to gain experience and capture epistemic uncertainty about the environment dynamics. Then, when dropped into a new environment, it employs a pessimistic exploration policy, selecting actions that have the best worst-case performance as forecasted by the probabilistic model. We show that this simple maximin policy accelerates domain adaptation in a safety-critical driving environment with varying vehicle sizes. We compare our approach against other approaches for adapting to new environments.</p>

> <p>Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has become an increasingly important research topic in machine learning. It targets at searching for two non-negative matrices (\textit{i.e.}, feature matrix \textbf{A} and weight matrix \textbf{X}) whose product can well approximate the original matrix \textbf{Y}. Despite all the practical success, most of existing NMF models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Adversarial NMF (ANMF) approach in which an adversary can exercise some control over the perturbed data generation process. Different from the traditional NMF models which focus on either the regular input or certain types of noise, our model considers potential test adversaries that are beyond the pre-defined constraints, which can cope with various noises (or perturbations). We formulate the proposed model as a bilevel optimization problem and use Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve it with convergence analysis. Theoretically, the robustness analysis of ANMF is established under mild conditions dedicating asymptotically unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments verify that ANMF is robust to a broad categories of perturbations, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on distinct real-world benchmark datasets.</p>

> <p>Non-autoregressive machine translation models significantly speed up decoding by allowing for parallel prediction of the entire target sequence. However, modeling word order is more challenging due to the lack of autoregressive factors in the model. This difficultly is compounded during training with cross entropy loss, which can highly penalize small shifts in word order. In this paper, we propose aligned cross entropy (AXE) as an alternate loss function for training of non-autoregressive models. AXE uses a differentiable dynamic program to assign loss based on the best possible monotonic alignment between target tokens and model predictions. AXE-based non-monotonic training of conditional masked language models (CMLMs) improves performance by 3 and 5 BLEU points respectively on WMT 16 EN-RO and WMT 14 EN-DE. It also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models on a range of translation benchmarks.</p>

> <p>There exist several inherent trade-offs while designing a fair model, such as those between the modelâs predictive accuracy and fairness, or even among different  notions of fairness. In practice, exploring these trade-offs requires significant human and computational resources.  We propose a diagnostic to enable practitioners to explore these trade-offs without training a single model. Our work hinges on the observation that many widely-used fairness definitions can be expressed via the fairness-confusion tensor, an object obtained by splitting the traditional confusion matrix according to protected data attributes. Our diagnostic optimizes accuracy and fairness objectives directly over the elements in this tensor in a data-dependent, yet model-agnostic fashion. We further leverage our tensor-based perspective to generalize existing theoretical impossibility results to a wider range of fairness definitions. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed diagnostic on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

> <p>Shapley value is a classic notion from game theory, historically used to quantify the contributions of individuals within groups, and more recently applied to assign values to data points when training machine learning models. Despite its foundational role, a key limitation of the data Shapley framework is that it only provides valuations for points within a fixed data set. It does not account for statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to reason about points outside the data set. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework -- distributional Shapley -- where the value of a point is defined in the context of an underlying data distribution. We prove that distributional Shapley has several desirable statistical properties; for example, the values are stable under perturbations to the data points themselves and to the underlying data distribution. We leverage these properties to develop a new algorithm for estimating values from data, which comes with formal guarantees and runs two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art algorithms for computing the (non-distributional) data Shapley values. We apply distributional Shapley to diverse data sets and demonstrate its utility in a data market setting.</p>

> Low rank matrix factorization is a fundamental building block in machine learning, used for instance to summarize gene expression profile data or word-document counts. To be robust to outliers and differences in scale across features, a matrix factorization step is usually preceded by ad-hoc feature normalization steps, such as tf-idf scaling or data whitening. We propose in this work to learn these normalization operators jointly with the factorization itself. More precisely, given a $d\times n$ matrix $X$ of $d$ features measured on $n$ individuals, we propose to learn the parameters of quantile normalization operators that can operate row-wise on the values of $X$ and/or of its factorization $UV$  to improve the quality of the low-rank representation of $X$ itself. This optimization is facilitated by the introduction of differentiable quantile normalization operators derived using regularized optimal transport algorithms.

> <p>Entropy is ubiquitous in machine learning, but it is in general intractable to compute the entropy of the distribution of an arbitrary continuous random variable. In this paper, we propose the amortized residual denoising autoencoder (AR-DAE) to approximate the gradient of the log density function, which can be used to estimate the gradient of entropy. Amortization allows us to significantly reduce the error of the gradient approximator by approaching asymptotic optimality of a regular DAE, in which case the estimation is in theory unbiased. We conduct theoretical and experimental analyses on the approximation error of the proposed method, as well as extensive studies on heuristics to ensure its robustness. Finally, using the proposed gradient approximator to estimate the gradient of entropy, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on density estimation with variational autoencoders and continuous control with soft actor-critic.</p>

  Jiaming Song, Stefano Ermon [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5361-Metadata.json)
> <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) variants approximately minimize divergences between the model and the data distribution using a discriminator. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) enjoy superior empirical performance, however, unlike in f-GANs, the discriminator does not provide an estimate for the ratio between model and data densities, which is useful in applications such as inverse reinforcement learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose an new training objective where we additionally optimize over a set of importance weights over the generated samples. By suitably constraining the feasible set of importance weights, we obtain a family of objectives which includes and generalizes the original f-GAN and WGAN objectives. We show that a natural extension outperforms WGANs while providing density ratios as in f-GAN, and demonstrate empirical success on distribution modeling, density ratio estimation and image generation, where we achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR10 generation.</p>

  Hengyuan Hu, Alexander Peysakhovich, Adam Lerer, Jakob Foerster [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5369-Metadata.json)
> <p>We consider the problem of zero-shot coordination - constructing AI agents that can coordinate with novel partners they have not seen before (e.g.humans). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods typically focus on the self-play (SP) setting where agents construct strategies by playing the game with themselves repeatedly. Unfortunately, applying SP naively to the zero-shot coordination problem can produce agents that establish highly specialized conventions that do not carry over to novel partners they have not been trained with. We introduce a novel learning algorithm called other-play (OP), that enhances self-play by looking for more robust strategies. We characterize OP theoretically as well as experimentally. We study the cooperative card game Hanabi and show that OP agents achieve higher scores when paired with independently trained agents as well as with human players than SP agents.</p>

  Jafar Jafarov, Sanchit Kalhan, Konstantin Makarychev, Yury Makarychev [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5386-Metadata.json)
> In the Correlation Clustering problem, we are given a weighted graph $G$ with its edges labelled as &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;dissimilar&quot; by a binary classifier. The goal is to produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of &quot;disagreements&quot;: the sum of the weights of &quot;similar&quot; edges across clusters and &quot;dissimilar&quot; edges within clusters. We study the correlation clustering problem under the following assumption: Every &quot;similar&quot; edge $e$ has weight $w_e \in [ \alpha w, w ]$ and every &quot;dissimilar&quot; edge $e$ has weight $w_e \geq \alpha w$ (where $\alpha \leq 1$ and $w &gt; 0$ is a scaling parameter). We give a $(3 + 2 \log_e (1/\alpha))$ approximation algorithm for this problem. This assumption captures well the scenario when classification errors are asymmetric. Additionally, we show an asymptotically matching Linear Programming integrality gap of $\Omega(\log 1/\alpha)$.

> <p>Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using a fixed offline dataset of logged interactions is an important consideration in real world applications. This paper studies offline RL using the DQN replay dataset comprising the entire replay experience of a DQN agent on 60 Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that recent off-policy deep RL algorithms, even when trained solely on this fixed dataset, outperform the fully trained DQN agent. To enhance generalization in the offline setting, we present Random Ensemble Mixture (REM), a robust Q-learning algorithm that enforces optimal Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of multiple Q-value estimates. Offline REM trained on the DQN replay dataset surpasses strong RL baselines. Ablation studies highlight the role of offline dataset size and diversity as well as the algorithm choice in our positive results. Overall, the results here present an optimistic view that robust RL algorithms trained on sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can lead to high quality policies. The DQN replay dataset can serve as an offline RL benchmark and is open-sourced.</p>

> <p>Lifelong learning has recently attracted attention in building machine learning systems that continually accumulate and transfer knowledge to help future learning. Unsupervised topic modeling has been popularly used to discover topics from document collections. However, the application of topic modeling is challenging due to data sparsity, e.g., in a small collection of (short) documents and thus, generate incoherent topics and sub-optimal document representations. To address the problem, we propose a lifelong learning framework for neural topic modeling that can continuously process streams of document collections, accumulate topics and guide future topic modeling tasks by knowledge transfer from several sources to better deal with the sparse data. In the lifelong process, we particularly investigate jointly: (1) sharing generative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer prior knowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past learning via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic regularization approaches. Given a stream of document collections, we apply the proposed Lifelong Neural Topic Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three sparse document collections as future tasks and demonstrate improved performance quantified by perplexity, topic coherence and information retrieval task.</p>

> <p>Recent research has achieved impressive results on understanding and improving source code by building up on machine-learning techniques developed for natural languages. A significant advancement in natural-language understanding has come with the development of pre-trained con-textual embeddings such as BERT. These can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks with less labeled data and training budget, while achieving better accuracies. However, there is no attempt yet to obtain a high-quality contextual embedding of source code, and to evaluate it on multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>  <p>In this paper, we alleviate this gap by curating a code-understanding benchmark and evaluating a learned contextual embedding of source code. More specifically, we curate a massive, deduplicated corpus of Python code from GitHub and train a BERT model, which we call B4C. We also create a benchmark comprising five classification tasks and one program-repair task, akin to code-understanding tasks proposed in the literature before. For comparison, we train different variants of Word2Vec token embeddings, and BiLSTM and Transformer models. For the repair task, we also compare to SOTA models. We show that fine-tuned B4C models give better results, even with shorter training or fewer examples. Future work on source-code embedding could benefit from reusing our benchmark and comparing against B4C as a strong baseline.</p>

  Changxiao Cai, H. Vincent Poor, Yuxin Chen [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5403-Metadata.json)
> <p>We study the distribution and uncertainty of nonconvex optimization for noisy tensor completion --- the problem of estimating a low-rank tensor given incomplete and corrupted observations of its entries. Focusing on a two-stage nonconvex estimation algorithm, we characterize the distribution of this estimator down to fine scales. This distributional theory in turn allows one to construct valid and short confidence intervals for both the unseen tensor entries and its underlying tensor factors. The proposed inferential procedure enjoys several important features: (1) it is fully adaptive to noise heteroscedasticity, and (2) it is data-driven and adapts automatically to unknown noise distributions. Furthermore, our findings unveil the statistical optimality of nonconvex tensor completion: it attains un-improvable estimation accuracy --- including both the rates and the pre-constants --- under i.i.d. Gaussian noise.</p>

> <p>The construction in the recent paper by Du et al. [2019] implies that searching for a near-optimal action in a bandit sometimes requires examining essentially all the actions, even if the learner is given linear features in R^d that approximate the rewards with a small uniform error. We use the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem to prove a positive result that by checking only a few actions, a learner can always find an action that is suboptimal with an error of at most O(Îµâd) where Îµ is the approximation error of the features. Thus, features are useful when the approximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features. The idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a generative model where the learner has access to d-dimensional linear features that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an accuracy of Îµ. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of order dâ(n log(k)) + Îµnâd log(n) with k the number of actions and n the horizon. For RL we show that approximate policy iteration can learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order Îµâd/(1 â Î³)^2 and using about d/(Îµ^2(1 â Î³)^4) samples from the generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the features. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.</p>

> <p>Recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to impressive performance but often suffer from poor calibration. They tend to be overconfident, with the model confidence not always reflecting the underlying true ambiguity and hardness. In this paper, we propose angular visual hardness (AVH), a score given by the normalized angular distance between the sample feature embedding and the target classifier to measure sample hardness. We validate this score with in-depth and extensive scientific study and observe that CNN models with the highest accuracy also have the best AVH scores. This agrees with an earlier finding that state-of-art models improve on the classification of harder examples. We observe that the training dynamics of AVH is vastly different compared to the training loss. Specifically, AVH quickly reaches a plateau for all samples even though the training loss keeps improving. This suggests the need for designing better loss functions that can target harder examples more effectively. We also find that AVH has a statistically significant correlation with human visual hardness. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of AVH to a variety of applications such as self-training for domain adaptation and domain generalization. </p>

> <p>We present a new method for evaluating and training unnormalized density models. Our approach only requires access to the gradient of the unnormalized modelâs log-density. We  estimate the Stein discrepancy between the data density p(x) and the model density q(x) based on a vector function of the data.  We parameterize this function with a neural network and fit its parameters to maximize this discrepancy.  This yields a novel goodness-of-fit test which outperforms existing methods on high dimensional data. Furthermore, optimizing q(x) to minimize this discrepancy produces a novel method for training unnormalized models. This training method can fit large unnormalized models faster than existing approaches. The ability to both learn and compare models is a unique feature of the proposed method.</p>

> <p>Particle-based Variational Inference methods (ParVIs), like Stein Variational Gradient Descent, are nonparametric variational inference methods that optimize a set of particles to best approximate a target distribution. ParVIs have been proposed as efficient approximate inference algorithms and as potential alternatives to MCMC methods. However, to our knowledge, the quality of the posterior approximation of particles from ParVIs has not been examined before for challenging, large-scale Bayesian inference problems. In this paper, we find that existing ParVI approaches converge insufficiently fast under sample quality metrics, and we propose a novel variance reduction and quasi-Newton preconditioning framework for all ParVIs, by leveraging the Riemannian structure of the Wasserstein space and advanced Riemannian optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the accelerated convergence of ParVIs for accurate posterior inference in large-scale and ill-conditioned problems.</p>

> The expressivity of neural networks as a function of their depth, width and type of activation units has been an important question in deep learning theory. Recently, depth separation results for ReLU networks were obtained via a new connection with dynamical systems, using a generalized notion of fixed points of a continuous map $f$, called periodic points. In this work, we strengthen the connection with dynamical systems and we improve the existing width lower bounds along several aspects. Our first main result is period-specific width lower bounds that hold under the stronger notion of $L^1$-approximation error, instead of the weaker classification error. Our second contribution is that we provide sharper width lower bounds, still yielding meaningful exponential depth-width separations, in regimes where previous results wouldn&#x27;t apply. A byproduct of our results is that there exists a universal constant characterizing the depth-width trade-offs, as long as $f$ has odd periods. Technically, our results follow by unveiling a tighter connection between the following three quantities of a given function: its period, its Lipschitz constant and the growth rate of the number of oscillations arising under compositions of the function $f$ with itself.

> <p>A framework based on iterative coordinate minimization (CM) is developed for stochastic convex optimization. Given that exact coordinate minimization is impossible due to the unknown stochastic nature of the objective function, the crux of the proposed optimization algorithm is an optimal control of the minimization precision in each iteration.  We establish the optimal precision control and the resulting order-optimal regret performance for strongly convex and separably nonsmooth functions.  An interesting finding is that the optimal progression of precision across iterations is independent of the low-dimension CM routine employed, suggesting a general framework for extending low-dimensional optimization routines to high-dimensional problems. The proposed algorithm is amenable to online implementation and inherits the scalability and parallelizability  properties of CM for large-scale optimization. Requiring only a sublinear order of message exchanges,  it also lends itself well to distributed computing as compared with the alternative approach of coordinate gradient descent.</p>

> <p>Adversarial examples are malicious inputs crafted to induce misclassification. Commonly studied \emph{sensitivity-based} adversarial examples introduce semantically-small changes to an input that result in a different model prediction.  This paper studies a complementary failure mode, \emph{invariance-based} adversarial examples, that introduce minimal semantic changes that modify an input's true label yet preserve the model's prediction. We demonstrate fundamental tradeoffs between these two types of adversarial examples.</p>  <p>We show that defenses against sensitivity-based attacks  actively harm a model's accuracy on invariance-based attacks, and that new approaches are needed to resist both attack types. In particular, we break state-of-the-art adversarially-trained and \emph{certifiably-robust} models by generating small perturbations that the models are (provably) robust to, yet that change an input's class according to human labelers. Finally, we formally show that the existence of excessively invariant classifiers arises from the presence of \emph{overly-robust} predictive features in standard datasets. </p>

> <p>In many predictive decision-making scenarios, such as credit scoring and academic testing, a decision-maker must construct a model that accounts for agents' incentives to ``game'' their features in order to receive better decisions. Whereas the strategic classification literature generally assumes that agents' outcomes are not causally dependent on their features (and thus strategic behavior is a form of lying), we join concurrent work in modeling agents' outcomes as a function of their changeable attributes. Our formulation is the first to incorporate a crucial phenomenon: when agents act to change observable features, they may as a side effect perturb unobserved features that causally affect their true outcomes. We consider three distinct desiderata for a decision-maker's model: accurately predicting agents' post-gaming outcomes (accuracy), incentivizing agents to improve these outcomes (improvement), and, in the linear setting, estimating the visible coefficients of the true causal model (causal precision). As our main contribution, we provide the first algorithms for learning accuracy-optimizing, improvement-optimizing, and causal-precision-optimizing linear regression models directly from data, without prior knowledge of agents' possible actions. These algorithms circumvent the hardness result of Miller et al. (2019) by allowing the decision maker to observe agents' responses to a sequence of decision rules, in effect inducing agents to perform causal interventions for free.</p>

> <p>We consider distributions arising from a mixture of causal models, where each model is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We provide a graphical representation of such mixture distributions and prove that this representation encodes the conditional independence relations of the mixture distribution. We  then  consider  the  problem  of  structure  learning  based  on  samples  from  such distributions. Since the mixing variable is latent, we consider causal structure discovery algorithms such as FCI that can deal with latent variables. We show that such algorithms recover a âunionâ of the component DAGs and can identify variables whose conditional distribution across the component DAGs vary. We demonstrate our results on synthetic and real data showing that the inferred graph identifies nodes that vary between the different mixture components. As an immediate application, we demonstrate how retrieval of this causal information can be used to cluster samples according to each mixture component.</p>

> <p>Marrying topic models and language models expose language understanding to a broader source of document-level context beyond sentences via topics. While introducing topical semantics in language models, existing approaches incorporate latent document topic proportions and ignore topical discourse in sentences of the document. This work extends the line of research by additionally introducing an explainable topic representation in language understanding, obtained from a set of key terms correspondingly for each latent topic of the proportion. Moreover, we retain sentence-topic associations along with document-topic association by modeling topical discourse for every sentence in the document. We present a novel neural composite language model that exploits both the latent and explainable topics along with topical discourse at sentence-level in a joint learning framework of topic and language models. Experiments over a range of tasks such as language modeling, word sense disambiguation, document classification, retrieval and text generation demonstrate ability of the proposed model in improving language understanding.</p>

> <p>Contrastive representation learning has been outstandingly successful in practice. In this work, we identify two key properties related to the contrastive loss: (1) alignment (closeness) of features from positive pairs, and (2) uniformity of the induced distribution of the (normalized) features on the hypersphere. We prove that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss indeed optimizes these properties, and analyze their positive effects on downstream tasks. Empirically, we introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property. Extensive experiments on standard image classification and depth prediction datasets confirm the strong agreement between both metrics and downstream task performance. Remarkably, directly optimizing for these two metrics leads to representations with comparable or better performance at downstream tasks than contrastive learning.</p>

> <p>The goal of universal machine translation is to learn to translate between any pair of languages, given pairs of translated documents for \emph{some} of these languages. Despite impressive empirical results and an increasing interest in massively multilingual models, theoretical analysis on translation errors made by such universal machine translation models is only nascent. In this paper, we take one step towards better understanding of universal machine translation by first proving an impossibility theorem in the general case. In particular, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the many-to-one translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to learn shared sentence representations among multiple language pairs has to make a large translation error on at least one of the translation tasks, if no assumption on the structure of the languages is made. On the positive side, we show that if the documents follow a natural encoder-decoder generative process, then we can expect a natural notion of ``generalization'': a linear number of pairs, rather than quadratic, suffices. Our theory also explains what kinds of connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with longer paths result in worse sample complexity in terms of the total number of documents per language pair needed.</p>

They are capable of solving standard inverse problems such as denoising and compressive sensing with excellent results by simply fitting a neural network model to measurements from a single image or signal without the need for any additional training data. For some applications, this critically requires additional regularization in the form of early stopping the optimization. For signal recovery from a few measurements, however, un-trained convolutional networks have an intriguing self-regularizing property: Even though the network can perfectly fit any image, the network recovers a natural image from few measurements when trained with gradient descent until convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate this property numerically and study it theoretically. We show that---without any further regularization---an un-trained convolutional neural network can approximately reconstruct signals and images that are sufficiently structured, from a near minimal number of random measurements.</p>

> <p>Unordered, variable-sized inputs arise in many settings across multiple fields.  The ability for set- and multiset- oriented neural networks to handle this type of input has been the focus of much work in recent years.  We propose to represent multisets using complex-weighted multiset automata and show how the multiset representations of certain existing neural architectures can be viewed as special cases of ours.  Namely, (1) we provide a new theoretical and intuitive justification for the Transformer model's representation of positions using sinusoidal functions, and (2) we extend the DeepSets model to use complex numbers, enabling it to outperform the existing model on an extension of one of their tasks.  </p>

> <p>In the transfer learning problem, the target and the source data domains are typically known. In this article, we study a new paradigm called mutual transfer learning where among many heterogeneous data domains, every data domain could potentially be the target of interest, and it could also be a useful source to help the learning in other data domains. However, it is important to note that given a target not every data domain can be a successful source; only data sets that are similar enough to be thought as from the same population can be useful sources for each other. Under this mutual learnability assumption, a confidence distribution fusion approach is proposed to recover the mutual learnability relation in the transfer learning regime. Our proposed method achieves the same oracle statistical inferential accuracy as if the true learnability structure were known. It can be implemented in an efficient parallel fashion to deal with large-scale data. Simulated and real examples are analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.</p>

> <p>We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex optimization of a continuous and parameterized objective function and introduce a differentiable variant that enables us to differentiate the output of CEM with respect to the objective function's parameters. In the machine learning setting this brings CEM inside of the end-to-end learning pipeline where this has otherwise been impossible. We show applications in a synthetic energy-based structured prediction task and in non-convex continuous control. In the control setting we show how to embed optimal action sequences into a lower-dimensional space. This enables us to use policy optimization to fine-tune modeling components by differentiating through the CEM-based controller.</p>

> One popular trend in meta-learning is to learn from many training tasks a common initialization for a gradient-based method that can be used to solve a new task with few samples. The theory of meta-learning is still in its early stages, with several recent learning-theoretic analyses of methods such as Reptile \cite{nichol:18} being for {\em convex models}. This work shows that convex-case analysis might be insufficient to understand the success of meta-learning, and that even for non-convex models it is important to look inside the optimization black-box, specifically at properties of the optimization trajectory. We construct a simple meta-learning instance that captures the problem of one-dimensional subspace learning. For the convex formulation of linear regression on this instance, we show that the new task sample complexity of any {\em initialization-based meta-learning} algorithm is $\Omega(d)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. In contrast, for the non-convex formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, we show that both Reptile and multi-task representation learning can have new task sample complexity of $\gO(1)$, demonstrating a separation from convex meta-learning. Crucially, analyses of the training dynamics of these methods reveal that they can meta-learn the correct subspace onto which the data should be projected.

> <p>We study Nesterov's accelerated gradient method in the stochastic approximation setting (unbiased gradients with bounded variance) and the finite sum setting (where randomness is due to sampling mini-batches). To build better insight into the behavior of Nesterov's method in stochastic settings, we focus throughout on objectives that are smooth, strongly-convex, and twice continuously differentiable. In the stochastic approximation setting, Nesterov's method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal point at the same accelerated rate as in the deterministic setting. Perhaps surprisingly, in the finite-sum setting we prove that Nesterov's method may diverge with the usual choice of step-size and momentum, unless additional conditions on the problem related to conditioning and data coherence are satisfied. Our results shed light as to why Nesterov's method may fail to converge or achieve acceleration in the finite-sum setting.</p>

> <p>Reinforcement learning with function approximation can be unstable and even divergent, especially when combined with off-policy learning and Bellman updates. In deep reinforcement learning, these issues have been dealt with empirically by adapting and regularizing the representation, in particular with auxiliary tasks. This suggests that representation learning may provide a means to guarantee stability. In this paper, we formally show that there are indeed nontrivial state representations under which the canonical SARSA algorithm is stable, even when learning off-policy. We analyze representation learning schemes that are based on the transition matrix of a policy, such as proto-value functions, along three axes: approximation error, stability, and ease of estimation. In the most general case of a defective transition matrix, we show that a Schur basis provides convergence guarantees, but is difficult to estimate from samples. For a fixed reward function, we find that an orthogonal basis of the corresponding Krylov subspace is an even better choice. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that these stable representations can be learned using stochastic gradient descent, opening the door to improved techniques for representation learning with deep networks.</p>

> We present a new piecewise linear regression methodology that utilises fitting a \emph{difference of convex} functions (DC functions) to the data. These are functions $f$ that may be represented as the difference $\phi_1 - \phi_2$ for a choice of \emph{convex} functions $\phi_1, \phi_2$. The method proceeds by estimating piecewise-liner convex functions, in a manner similar to max-affine regression, whose difference approximates the data. The choice of the function is regularised by a new seminorm over the class of DC functions that controls the $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz constant of the estimate. The resulting methodology can be efficiently implemented via Quadratic programming \emph{even in high dimensions}, and is shown to have close to minimax statistical risk. We empirically validate the method, showing it to be practically implementable, and to outperform existing regression methods in accuracy on real-world datasets.

> The top-$k$ error is often employed to evaluate performance for challenging classification tasks in computer vision as it is designed to compensate for ambiguity in ground truth labels. This practical success motivates our theoretical analysis of consistent top-$k$ classification. To this end, we provide a characterization of Bayes optimality by defining a top-$k$ preserving property, which is new and fixes a non-uniqueness gap in prior work. Then, we define top-$k$ calibration and show it is necessary and sufficient for consistency.  Based on the top-$k$ calibration analysis, we propose a rich class of top-$k$ calibrated Bregman divergence surrogates. Our analysis continues by showing previously proposed hinge-like top-$k$ surrogate losses are not top-$k$ calibrated and thus inconsistent. On the other hand, we propose two new hinge-like losses, one which is similarly inconsistent, and one which is consistent. Our empirical results highlight theoretical claims, confirming our analysis of the consistency of these losses.

> <p>We propose an efficient inference method for switching nonlinear dynamical systems. The key idea is to learn an inference network which can be used as a proposal distribution for the continuous latent variables, while performing exact marginalization of the discrete latent variables. This allows us to use the reparameterization trick, and apply end-to-end training with stochastic gradient descent. We show that the proposed method can successfully segment time series data, including videos and 3D human pose, into meaningful ``regimes'' by using the piece-wise nonlinear dynamics. </p>

> <p>Using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in machine learning tasks is promising in delivering high-quality results but challenging to meet stringent latency requirements and energy constraints because of the memory-bound and the compute-bound execution pattern of DNNs. We propose a big-little dual-module inference to dynamically skip unnecessary memory access and computation to speedup DNN inference. Leveraging the error-resilient feature of nonlinear activation functions used in DNNs, we propose to use a lightweight little module that approximates the original DNN layer, which is referred to as the big module, to compute activations of the insensitive region that are more error-resilient. The expensive memory access and computation of the big module can be reduced as the results are only used in the sensitive region. For memory-bound models, our method can reduce the overall memory access by 40% on average and achieve 1.54x to 1.75x speedup on a commodity CPU-based server platform with a negligible impact on model quality. In addition, our method can reduce the operations of the compute-bound ResNet model by 3.02x, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop.</p>

> <p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages unlabeled data when training a model with insufficient labeled data. A common strategy for SSL is to enforce the consistency of model outputs between similar samples, e.g., neighbors or data augmentations of the same sample. However, model outputs can vary dramatically on unlabeled data over different training stages, e.g., when using large learning rates. This can introduce harmful noises and inconsistent objectives over time that may lead to concept drift and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we study the dynamics of neural net outputs in SSL and show that selecting and using first the unlabeled samples with more consistent outputs over the course of training (i.e., "time-consistency") can improve the final test accuracy and save computation. Under the time-consistent data selection, we design an SSL objective composed of two self-supervised losses, i.e., a consistency loss between a sample and its augmentation, and a contrastive loss encouraging different samples to have different outputs. Our approach achieves SOTA on several SSL benchmarks with much fewer computations.</p>

> <p>In model-based reinforcement learning, planning with an imperfect model of the environment has the potential to harm learning progress. But even when a model is imperfect, it may still contain information that is useful for planning. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using an imperfect model selectively.  The agent should plan in parts of the state space where the model would be helpful but refrain from using the model where it would be harmful. An effective selective planning mechanism requires estimating predictive uncertainty, which arises out of aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Prior work has focused on parameter uncertainty, a particular kind of epistemic uncertainty, for selective planning. In this work, we emphasize the importance of structural uncertainty, a distinct kind of epistemic uncertainty that signals the errors due to limited capacity or a misspecified model class.  We show that heteroscedastic regression, under an isotropic Gaussian assumption, can signal structural uncertainty that is complementary to that which is detected by methods designed to detect parameter uncertainty, indicating that considering both parameter and structural uncertainty may be a more promising direction for effective selective planning than either in isolation.</p>

> <p>Clustering is a foundational problem in machine learning with numerous applications. As machine learning increases in ubiquity as a backend for automated systems, concerns about fairness arise. Much of the current literature on fairness deals with discrimination against protected classes in supervised learning (group fairness). We define a different notion of fair clustering wherein the probability that two points (or a community of points) become separated is bounded by an increasing function of their pairwise distance (or community diameter). We capture the situation where data points represent people who gain some benefit from being clustered together. Unfairness arises when certain points are deterministically separated, either arbitrarily or by someone who intends to harm them as in the case of gerrymandering election districts. In response, we formally define two new types of fairness in the clustering setting, pairwise fairness and community preservation. To explore the practicality of our fairness goals, we devise an approach for extending existing k-center algorithms to satisfy these fairness constraints. In doing so, we show that reasonable approximations can be achieved while maintaining fairness. In experiments, we compare the effectiveness of our approach to classical k-center algorithms/heuristics and explore the tradeoff between optimal clustering and fairness.</p>

> <p>Neural networks have a remarkable capacity for contextual processingâusing recent or nearby inputs to modify processing of current input. For example, in natural language, contextual processing is necessary to correctly interpret negation (e.g. phrases such as "not bad"). However, our ability to understand how networks process context is limited. Here, we propose general methods for reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce contextual effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of these effects, and identifies sets of these inputs with similar properties. Additionally, we analyze contextual effects related to differential processing of the beginning and end of documents. Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual modification, recovering greater than 90% of the RNN's performance increase over the baseline. This work yields a new understanding of how RNNs process contextual information, and provides tools that should provide similar insight more broadly.</p>

> <p>Regression forests (ensembles of regression trees) have long been recognized as the leading off-the-shelf method for regression, where the task is to predict a continuous scalar or vector output. The main approaches are based on bagging, where individual trees are trained independently on bootstrap samples of the data; or on boosting, where individual trees are trained sequentially on the whole data but with adaptively weighted instances. However, both approaches rely on a greedy top-down procedure such as CART to learn an axis-aligned tree, where each decision node tests for a single feature. We instead use the recently proposed Tree Alternating Optimization (TAO) algorithm. This is able to learn an oblique tree, where each decision node tests for a linear combination of features, and which has much higher accuracy than axis-aligned trees. We show that using TAO with the bagging approach produces much better forests than random forests, Adaboost or gradient boosting in every dataset we have tried across a wide range of input and output dimensionality and sample size. The resulting forest has significantly lower test regression error while using shallower trees with fewer parameters and lower inference time overall. This result has an immense practical impact and advocates for the power of optimization in ensemble learning.</p>

> <p>The deep layers of modern neural networks extract a rather rich set of features as an input propagates through the network. This paper sets out to harvest these rich intermediate representations for quantization with minimal accuracy loss while significantly reducing the memory footprint and compute intensity of the DNN. This paper utilizes knowledge distillation through teacher-student paradigm (Hinton et al., 2015) in a novel setting that exploits the feature extraction capability of DNNs for higher-accuracy quantization. As such, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to multiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team of students independently in the quantized domain. This divide and conquer strategy, in fact, makes the training of each student section possible in isolation while all these independently trained sections are later stitched together to form the equivalent fully quantized network. Our algorithm is a sectional approach towards knowledge distillation and is not treating the intermediate representation as a hint for pretraining before one knowledge distillation pass over the entire network (Romero et al., 2015). Experiments on various DNNs (AlexNet, LeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN and VGG-11) show that, on average, this approachâcalled DCQ (Divide and Conquer Quantization)âon average closes the accuracy gap between a state-of-the-art quantized training technique, DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) and the full-precision runs by 85% and 92% for binary and ternary quantization of the weights, respectively. Additionally, we show that our approach, DCQ, can improve performance of existing state-of-the art knowledge-distillation based approaches (Mishra et al., 2018) by 1.75% on average for both weight and activation quantization.</p>

> <p>Submodular functions have been studied extensively in machine learning and data mining. In particular, the optimization of submodular functions over  the integer lattice has recently attracted much interest, because this domain relates naturally to many practical problem settings, such as multilabel graph cut, budget allocation and revenue maximization with discrete assignments. In contrast, the use of these functions for probabilistic modeling has received surprisingly little attention so far.  In this work, we firstly propose the Generalized Multilinear Extension, a continuous DR-Submodular extension for integer submodular functions. We study central properties of this extension and formulate a new probabilistic model which is defined through integer submodular functions. Then, we introduce a method to perform approximate inference for those class of models. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness and viability on several real-world social connection graph datasets with integer submodular objectives.</p>

> <p>One of the most surprising and exciting discoveries in supervised learning was the benefit of overparameterization (i.e. training a very large model) to improving the optimization landscape of a problem, with minimal effect on statistical performance (i.e. generalization). In contrast, unsupervised settings have been under-explored, despite the fact that it was observed that overparameterization can be helpful as early as Dasgupta &amp; Schulman (2007). We perform an empirical study of different aspects of overparameterization in unsupervised learning of latent variable models via synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. We discuss benefits to different metrics of success (recovering the parameters of the ground-truth model, held-out log-likelihood), sensitivity to variations of the training algorithm, and behavior as the amount of overparameterization increases. We find that across a variety of models (noisy-OR networks, sparse coding, probabilistic context-free grammars) and training algorithms (variational inference, alternating minimization, expectation-maximization), overparameterization can significantly increase the number of ground truth latent variables recovered.</p>

  Albert Gu, Caglar Gulcehre, Thomas Paine, Matthew Hoffman, Razvan Pascanu [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5650-Metadata.json)
> <p>Gating mechanisms are widely used in neural network models, where they allow gradients to backpropagate easily through depth or time. However, their saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono-initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.</p>

> <p>Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) demonstrate promising success in improving the robustness and uncertainty quantification of modern neural networks. However, they generally struggle with underfitting at scale and parameter efficiency. On the other hand, deep ensembles have emerged as an alternative for uncertainty quantification that, while outperforming BNNs on certain problems, also suffers from efficiency issues. It remains unclear how to combine the strengths of these two approaches and remediate their common issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a rank-1 parameterization of BNNs, where each weight matrix involves only a distribution on a rank-1 subspace. We also revisit the use of mixture approximate posteriors to capture multiple modes where unlike typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase (e.g., only a 0.4\% increase for a ResNet-50 mixture of size 10). We perform a systematic empirical study on the choices of prior, variational posterior, and methods to improve training. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet and Wide ResNet 28-10 on CIFAR-10/100, rank-1 BNNs demonstrate improved performance across log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration on the test set and out-of-distribution variants.</p>

> <p>In this paper we study how neural network architecture affects the speed of training. We introduce a simple concept called gradient confusion to help formally analyze this.  When confusion is high, stochastic gradients produced by different data samples may be negatively correlated, slowing down convergence. But when gradient confusion is low, data samples interact harmoniously, and training proceeds quickly. Through novel theoretical and experimental results, we show how the neural net architecture affects gradient confusion, and thus the efficiency of training. We show that for popular initialization techniques used in deep learning, increasing the width of neural networks leads to lower gradient confusion, and thus easier model training. On the other hand, increasing the depth of neural networks has the opposite effect. Finally, we observe that the combination of batch normalization and skip connections reduces gradient confusion, which helps reduce the training burden of very deep networks.</p>

> <p>The use of machine learning algorithms in finance, medicine, and criminal justice can deeply impact human lives. As a consequence, research into interpretable machine learning has rapidly grown in an attempt to better control and fix possible sources of mistakes and biases. Tree ensembles, in particular, offer a good prediction quality in various domains, but the concurrent use of multiple trees reduces the interpretability of the ensemble. Against this background, we study born-again tree ensembles, i.e., the process of constructing a single decision tree of minimum size that reproduces the exact same behavior as a given tree ensemble. To find such a tree, we develop a dynamic-programming based algorithm that exploits sophisticated pruning and bounding rules to reduce the number of recursive calls. This algorithm generates optimal born-again trees for many datasets of practical interest, leading to classifiers which are typically simpler and more interpretable without any other form of compromise.</p>

> <p>Off-policy evaluation plays an important role in modern reinforcement learning. However, most of the existing off-policy evaluation only focus on the value estimation, without providing an accountable confidence interval, that can reflect the uncertainty caused by limited observed data and algorithmic errors. Recently,  Feng  et  al.  (2019) proposed a novel kernel loss for learning value functions, which can also be used to test whether the learned value function satisfies the Bellman equation. In this work, we investigate the statistical properties of the kernel loss, which allows us to find a feasible set that contains the true value function with high probability. We further utilize this set to construct an accountable confidence interval for off-policy value estimation, and a post-hoc diagnosis for existing estimators. Empirical results show that our methods yield a tight yet accountable confidence interval in different settings, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

> <p>The Transformer architecture has achieved considerable success in areas such as language modeling and machine translation. The key component of the Transformer is the attention layer that enables the model to focus on important regions within the input sequence. Gradient optimization with attention layers can be notoriously difficult requiring tricks such as learning rate warmup to prevent divergence.  As Transformer models are becoming larger and more expensive to train, recent research has focused on understanding and improving optimization in these models. In this work our contributions are two-fold. We first investigate and empirically validate the source of optimization problems in encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.We then propose a new weight initialization scheme with theoretical justification, which enables training without warmup or layer normalization. Empirical results on public machine translation benchmarks show that our approach achieves leading accuracy, allowing to train deep Transformer models with 200 layers without difficulty. Full code for this work will be released with the final version of this draft.</p>

> <p>In the architecture and construction industries, structural design for large buildings has always been laborious, time-consuming, and difficult to optimize. It is an iterative process that involves two steps: analyzing the current structural design by a slow and computationally expensive simulation, and then manually revising the design based on professional experience and rules. In this work, we propose an end-to-end learning pipeline to solve the size design optimization problem, which is to design the optimal cross-sections for columns and beams, given the design objectives and building code as constraints. We pre-train a graph neural network as a surrogate model to not only replace the structural simulation for speed but also use its differentiable nature to provide gradient signals to the other graph neural network for size optimization. Our results show that the pre-trained surrogate model can predict simulation results accurately, and the trained optimization model demonstrates the capability of designing convincing cross-section designs for buildings under various scenarios.</p>

> <p>This paper studies few-shot relation extraction, which aims at predicting the relation for a pair of entities in a sentence by training with a few labeled examples in each relation. To more effectively generalize to new relations/tasks, in this paper we study the relationships between different tasks and propose to leverage a global task graph. We propose a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach to effectively learn the posterior distributions of the prototype vectors of tasks, where the initial prior of the prototype vectors is parameterized with a graph neural network on the global task graph. Moreover, to effectively optimize the posterior distributions of the prototype vectors, we propose to use the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamic, which can be related to the MAML algorithm but is able to handle the uncertainty of the prototype vectors. The whole framework can be effectively and efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on two benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach against competitive baselines in both the few-shot and zero-shot settings. </p>

  Jinshuo Dong, David Durfee, Ryan Rogers [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5709-Metadata.json)
> <p>Composition is one of the most important properties of differential privacy (DP), as it allows algorithm designers to build complex private algorithms from DP primitives. We consider precise composition bounds of the overall privacy loss for exponential mechanisms, one of the fundamental classes of mechanisms in DP. Exponential mechanism has also become a fundamental building block in private machine learning, e.g. private PCA and hyper-parameter selection. We give explicit formulations of the optimal privacy loss for both the adaptive and non-adaptive composition of exponential mechanism. For the non-adaptive setting in which each mechanism has the same privacy parameter, we give an efficiently computable formulation of the optimal privacy loss. In the adaptive case, we derive a recursive formula and an efficiently computable upper bound. These precise understandings about the problem lead to a 40\% saving of the privacy budget in a practical application. Furthermore, the algorithm-specific analysis shows a difference in privacy parameters of adaptive and non-adaptive composition, which was widely believed to not exist based on the evidence from general analysis.</p>

> <p>Weighted model integration (WMI) is a very appealing framework for probabilistic inference: it allows to express the complex dependencies of real-world scenarios where variables are both continuous and discrete, via the language of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), as well as to compute probabilistic queries with complex logical and arithmetic constraints. Yet, existing WMI solvers are not ready to scale to these problems. They either ignore the intrinsic dependency structure of the problem at all, or they are limited to too restrictive structures. To narrow this gap, we derive a factorized formalism of WMI enabling us to devise a scalable WMI solver based on message passing, MP-WMI. Namely MP-WMI is the first WMI solver which allows to: 1) perform exact inference on the full class of tree-structured WMI problems; 2) compute all the marginal densities in linear time; 3) amortize inference for any query conforming to the problem structure. Experimental results show that our solver dramatically outperforms the existing WMI solvers on a large set of benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Quantization based techniques are the current state-of-the-art for scaling maximum inner product search to massive databases. Traditional approaches to quantization aim to minimize the reconstruction error of the database points. Based on the observation that for a given query, the database points that have the largest inner products are more relevant, we develop a family of anisotropic quantization loss functions. Under natural statistical assumptions, we show that quantization with these loss functions leads to a new variant of vector quantization that more greatly penalizes the parallel component of a datapoint's residual relative to its orthogonal component. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the public benchmarks available at \url{ann-benchmarks.com}.</p>

> <p>We introduce a class of auto-encoder neural networks tailored to data from the natural exponential family (e.g., count data). The architectures are inspired by the problem of learning the filters in a convolutional generative model with sparsity constraints, often referred to as convolutional dictionary learning (CDL). Our work is the first to merge the ideas from convolutional generative models and deep learning for data that are naturally modeled with non-Gaussian distribution (e.g., binomial and Poisson). This perspective provides us with a scalable and flexible framework that can be re-purposed for a wide range of tasks and assumptions on the generative model. Specifically, the iterative optimization procedure for solving CDL, an unsupervised task, is mapped to an unfolded and constrained neural network, with iterative adjustments to the inputs to account for the generative distribution. We also show that the framework can easily be extended for discriminative training, appropriate for a supervised task. We demonstrate 1) that fitting the generative model to learn, in an unsupervised fashion, the latent stimulus that underlies neural spiking data leads to better goodness-of-fit compared to other baselines, 2) competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for supervised Poisson image denoising, with significantly fewer parameters, and 3) gradient dynamics of shallow binomial auto-encoder.</p>

>  We study generalization properties of weakly supervised learning. That is, learning where only a few ``strong&#x27;&#x27; labels (the actual target of our prediction) are present but many more ``weak&#x27;&#x27; labels are available. In particular, we show that having access to weak labels can significantly accelerate the learning rate for the strong task to the fast rate of $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac1n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of strongly labeled data points. This acceleration can happen even if by itself the strongly labeled data admits only the slower  $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ rate. The actual acceleration depends continuously on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks. Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task.

> <p>Machine learning (ML) systems often encounter Out-of-Distribution (OoD) errors when dealing with testing data coming from a distribution different from training data. It becomes important for ML systems in critical applications to accurately quantify its predictive uncertainty and screen out these anomalous inputs. However, existing OoD detection approaches are prone to errors and even sometimes assign higher likelihoods to OoD samples. Unlike standard learning tasks, there is currently no well established guiding principle for designing OoD detection architectures that can accurately quantify uncertainty. To address these problems, we first seek to identify guiding principles for designing uncertainty-aware architectures, by proposing Neural Architecture Distribution Search (NADS). NADS searches for a distribution of architectures that perform well on a given task, allowing us to identify common building blocks among all uncertainty-aware architectures. With this formulation, we are able to optimize a stochastic OoD detection objective and construct an ensemble of models to perform OoD detection. We perform multiple OoD detection experiments and observe that our NADS performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art OoD detection methods.</p>

> <p>Recent work has shown that topological enhancements to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can increase their expressiveness and representational capacity. Two popular enhancements are stacked RNNs, which increases the capacity for learning non-linear functions, and bidirectional processing, which exploits acausal information in a sequence. In this work, we explore the delayed-RNN, which is a single-layer RNN that has a delay between the input and output. We prove that a weight-constrained version of the delayed-RNN is equivalent to a stacked-RNN. We also show that the delay gives rise to partial acausality, much like bidirectional networks. Synthetic experiments confirm that the delayed-RNN can mimic bidirectional networks, solving some acausal tasks similarly, and outperforming them in others. Moreover, we show similar performance to bidirectional networks in a real-world natural language processing task. These results suggest that delayed-RNNs can approximate topologies including stacked RNNs, bidirectional RNNs, and stacked bidirectional RNNs -- but with equivalent or faster runtimes for the delayed-RNNs.</p>

> <p>While real-world decisions involve many competing objectives, algorithmic decisions are often evaluated with a single objective function. In this paper, we study algorithmic policies which explicitly trade off between a private objective (such as profit) and a public objective (such as social welfare). We analyze a natural class of policies which trace an empirical Pareto frontier based on learned scores, and focus on how such decisions can be made in noisy or data-limited regimes. Our theoretical results characterize the optimal strategies in this class, bound the Pareto errors due to inaccuracies in the scores, and show an equivalence between optimal strategies and a rich class of fairness-constrained profit-maximizing policies. We then present empirical results in two different contexts --- online content recommendation and sustainable abalone fisheries --- to underscore the generality of our approach to a wide range of practical decisions. Taken together, these results shed light on inherent trade-offs in using machine learning for decisions that impact social welfare.</p>

  Vasileios Lioutas, Yuhong Guo [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5762-Metadata.json)
> To date, most state-of-the-art sequence modeling architectures use attention to build generative models for language based tasks. Some of these models use all the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which results in time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\cdot}n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale standard machine translation, abstractive summarization and language modeling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other attention/convolution based approaches.

> <p>Models that employ latent variables to capture structure in observed data lie at the heart of many current unsupervised learning algorithms, but exact maximum-likelihood learning for powerful and flexible latent-variable models is almost always intractable. Thus, state-of-the-art approaches either abandon the maximum-likelihood framework entirely, or else rely on a variety of variational approximations to the posterior distribution over the latents. Here, we propose an alternative approach that we call amortised learning. Rather than computing an approximation to the posterior over latents, we use a wake-sleep Monte-Carlo strategy to learn a function that directly estimates the maximum-likelihood parameter updates. Amortised learning is possible whenever samples of latents and observations can be simulated from the generative model, treating the model as a ``black box''. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of complex models, including those with latents that are discrete or supported on non-Euclidean spaces. </p>

> <p>Real-world datasets are often biased with respect to key demographic factors such as race and gender. Due to the latent nature of the underlying factors, detecting and mitigating bias is especially challenging for unsupervised machine learning. We present a weakly supervised algorithm for overcoming dataset bias for deep generative models. Our approach requires access to an additional small, unlabeled but unbiased dataset as the supervision signal, thus sidestepping the need for explicit labels on the underlying bias factors. Using this supplementary dataset, we detect the bias in existing datasets via a density ratio technique and learn generative models which efficiently achieve the twin goals of: 1) data efficiency by using training examples from both biased and unbiased datasets for learning, 2) unbiased data generation at test time. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach which reduces bias w.r.t. latent factors by 37.2% on average over baselines for comparable image generation using generative adversarial networks.</p>

> Multi-step greedy policies have been extensively used in model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL), both when a model of the environment is available (e.g.,~in the game of Go) and when it is learned. In this paper, we explore the benefits of multi-step greedy policies in model-free RL when employed using the multi-step Dynamic Programming algorithms: $\kappa$-Policy Iteration ($\kappa$-PI) and $\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods iteratively compute the next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI) by solving a surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount factor. We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI in which the surrogate decision problem is solved by DQN and TRPO. We call the resulting algorithms $\kappa$-PI-DQN, $\kappa$-VI-DQN, $\kappa$-PI-TRPO, and $\kappa$-VI-TRPO and evaluate them on Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks. Our results indicate that for the right range of $\kappa$, our algorithms outperform DQN and TRPO. Moreover, we identify the importance of a hyper-parameter that controls the extent to which the surrogate decision problem is solved, and show how to set this parameter. Finally, we establish that $\kappa$-PI-TRPO coincides with the popular GAE algorithm.

> <p>We introduce "instability analysis," which assesses whether a neural network optimizes to the same, linearly connected minimum under different samples of SGD noise. We find that standard vision models become stable in this way early in training. From then on, the outcome of optimization is determined to within a linearly connected region.</p>  <p>We use instability to study iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), the procedure used by work on the lottery ticket hypothesis to identify subnetworks that could have trained to full accuracy from initialization. We find that these subnetworks only reach full accuracy when they are stable, which either occurs at initialization for small-scale settings (MNIST) or early in training for large-scale settings (Resnet-50 and Inception-v3 on ImageNet).</p>

> <p>We give the first superpolynomial lower bounds for learning one-layer neural networks with respect to the Gaussian distribution for a broad class of algorithms.  In the regression setting, we prove that gradient descent run on any classifier with respect to square loss will fail to achieve small test error in polynomial time.  Prior work held only for gradient descent run with small batch sizes and sufficiently smooth classifiers. For classification, we give a stronger result, namely that any statistical query (SQ) algorithm will fail to achieve small test error in polynomial time.  Our lower bounds hold for commonly used activations such as ReLU and sigmoid.  The core of our result relies on a novel construction of a simple family of neural networks that are exactly orthogonal with respect to all spherically symmetric distributions.</p>

> <p>We propose a novel approach to filter bank learning for time-series by considering spectral decompositions of signals defined as a Group Transform. This framework allows us to generalize classical time-frequency transformations such as the Wavelet Transform, and  to efficiently learn the representation of signals. While the creation of the wavelet transform filter-bank relies on affine transformations of a mother filter, our approach allows for non-linear transformations. The transformations induced by such maps enable us to span a larger class of signal representations, from wavelet to chirplet-like filters. We propose a parameterization of such a non-linear map such that its sampling can be optimized for a specific task and signal. The Learnable Group Transform can be cast into a Deep Neural Network. The experiments on diverse time-series datasets demonstrate the expressivity of this framework, which competes with state-of-the-art performances.</p>

> <p>We investigate the challenge of multi-output learning, where the goal is to learn a vector-valued function based on a supervised data set. This includes a range of important problems in Machine Learning including multi-target regression, multi-class classification and multi-label classification. We begin our analysis by introducing the self-bounding Lipschitz condition for multi-output loss functions, which interpolates continuously between a classical Lipschitz condition and a multi-dimensional analogue of a smoothness condition. We then show that the self-bounding Lipschitz condition gives rise to optimistic bounds for multi-output learning, which are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. The proof exploits local Rademacher complexity combined with a powerful minoration inequality due to Srebro, Sridharan and Tewari.  As an application we derive a state-of-the-art generalization bound for multi-class gradient boosting. </p>

> <p>When presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, deep neural networks yield confident, incorrect predictions. Detecting OOD examples is challenging, and the potential risks are high. In this paper, we propose to detect OOD examples by identifying inconsistencies between activity patterns and predicted class. We find that characterizing activity patterns by Gram matrices and identifying anomalies in Gram matrix values can yield high OOD detection rates. We identify anomalies in the Gram matrices by simply comparing each value with its respective range observed over the training data. Unlike many approaches, this can be used with any pre-trained softmax classifier and neither requires access to OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters, nor does it require OOD access for inferring parameters. We empirically demonstrate applicability across a variety of architectures and vision datasets and, for the important and surprisingly hard task of detecting far out-of-distribution examples, it generally performs better than or equal to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods (including those that do assume access to OOD examples).</p>

> <p>The variational autoencoder (VAE) can learn the manifold of natural images on certain datasets, as evidenced by meaningful interpolating or extrapolating in the continuous latent space. However, on discrete data such as text, it is unclear if unsupervised learning can discover similar latent space that allows controllable manipulation. In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, where the decoding network fails to generalize. Both as a validation of the explanation and as a fix to the problem, we propose to constrain the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex, and performs manipulation within this simplex. Our proposed method mitigates the latent vacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning of controllable representations for text. Empirically, our method outperforms unsupervised baselines and strong supervised approaches on text style transfer. On automatic evaluation metrics used in text style transfer, even with the decoding network trained from scratch, our method achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art supervised approaches leveraging large-scale pre-trained models for generation. Furthermore, it is capable of performing more flexible fine-grained control over text generation than existing methods.</p>

> Reinforcement learning (RL) applies to control problems with large state and action spaces, hence it is natural to consider RL with a parametric model. In this paper we focus on finite-horizon episodic RL where the transition model admits a nonlinear parametrization $P_{\theta}$, a special case of which is the linear parameterization: $P_{\theta} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} (\theta)_{i}P_{i}$.  We propose an upper confidence model-based RL algorithm with value-targeted model parameter estimation. The algorithm updates the estimate of $\theta$ by solving a nonlinear regression problem using the latest value estimate as the target. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by proving its expected regret bound which, in the special case of linear parameterization takes the form $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H, T, d$ are the horizon, total number of steps and dimension of $\theta$. This regret bound is independent of the total number of states or actions, and is close to a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{HdT})$. In the general nonlinear case, we handle the regret analysis by using the concept of Eluder dimension proposed by \citet{RuVR14}.

> <p>The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily for its use of non-local weight transport --- the biologically dubious requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local learning mechanisms.</p>

> <p>We extend structured prediction to deliberative outcomes. Specifically, we learn parameterized games that can map any inputs to equilibria as the outcomes. Standard structured prediction models rely heavily on global scoring functions and are therefore unable to model individual player preferences or how they respond to others asymmetrically. Our games take as input, e.g., UN resolution to be voted on, and map such contexts to initial strategies, player utilities, and interactions. Players are then thought to repeatedly update their strategies in response to weighted aggregates of other players' choices towards maximizing their individual utilities. The output from the game is a sample from the resulting (near) equilibrium mixed strategy profile. We characterize conditions under which players converge to an equilibrium in such games and when the game parameters can be provably recovered from observations. Empirically, we demonstrate on two real voting datasets that our games can recover interpretable strategic interactions, and predict strategies for players in new settings. </p>

> <p>We formally study the problem of classification under adversarial perturbations, both from the learner's perspective, and from the viewpoint of a third-party who aims at certifying the robustness of a given black-box classifier.  We further introduce and study a new setting of black-box certification under limited query budget. We analyze this for various classes of predictors and types of perturbation.  We also consider the viewpoint of a black-box adversary that aims at finding adversarial examples, showing that the existence of an adversary with polynomial query complexity implies the existence of a robust learner with small sample complexity.</p>

> <p>Recovering a signal from its Fourier intensity underlies many important applications, including lensless imaging and imaging through scattering media. Conventional algorithms for retrieving the phase suffer when noise is present but display global convergence when given clean data. Neural networks have been used to improve algorithm robustness, but efforts to date are sensitive to initial conditions and give inconsistent performance. Here, we combine iterative methods from phase retrieval with image statistics from deep denoisers, via regularization-by-denoising. The resulting methods inherit the advantages of each approach and outperform other noise-robust phase retrieval algorithms. Our work paves the way for hybrid imaging methods that integrate machine-learned constraints in conventional algorithms.</p>

> <p>Modern deep learning models employ considerably more parameters than required to fit the training data. Whereas conventional statistical wisdom suggests such models should drastically overfit, in practice these models generalize remarkably well. An emerging paradigm for describing this unexpected behavior is in terms of a double descent curve, in which increasing a model's capacity causes its test error to first decrease, then increase to a maximum near the interpolation threshold, and then decrease again in the overparameterized regime. Recent efforts to explain this phenomenon theoretically have focused on simple settings, such as linear regression or kernel regression with unstructured random features, which we argue are too coarse to reveal important nuances of actual neural networks. We provide a precise high-dimensional asymptotic analysis of generalization under kernel regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel, which characterizes the behavior of wide neural networks optimized with gradient descent. Our results reveal that the test error has nonmonotonic behavior deep in the overparameterized regime and can even exhibit additional peaks and descents when the number of parameters scales quadratic with the dataset size.</p>

> <p>An important problem in machine auditory perception is to recognize and detect sound events. In this paper, we propose a sequential self-teaching approach to learn sounds. Our main proposition is that it is harder to learn sounds in adverse situations such as from weakly labeled or noisy labeled data and in these situations a single stage of learning is not sufficient. Our proposal is a sequential stage-wise learning process that improves generalization capabilities of a given modeling system. We justify this via technical results. On Audioset, the largest sound events dataset, our sequential learning approach can lead to up to 9% improvement in performance. A comprehensive evaluation also shows that the model leads to improved transferability of knowledge from previously trained models, thereby leading to improved generalization capabilities on transfer learning tasks as well.</p>

> We make three contributions toward better understanding policy gradient methods. First, we show that with the true gradient, policy gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate, with constants depending on the problem and initialization. This result significantly improves recent asymptotic convergence results.  The analysis relies on two findings: that the softmax policy gradient satisfies a \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum probability of an optimal action during optimization can be bounded in terms of its initial value. Second, we analyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show that in the one state (bandit) case it enjoys a linear convergence rate $O(e^{-t})$,  while for general MDPs we prove that it converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate. This result resolves an open question in the recent literature. A key insight is that the entropy regularized gradient update behaves similarly to the contraction operator in value learning, with contraction factor depending on current policy. Finally, combining the above two results and additional lower bound results, we explain how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.  These results provide a theoretical understanding of the impact of entropy and corroborate existing empirical studies.

  Vivek Jayaram, John Thickstun [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5859-Metadata.json)
> <p>Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent deep generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains that are indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses deep generative models as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and Langevin dynamics to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, providing quantitative evaluation and qualitative discussion of results for CIFAR-10 image separation.</p>

> <p>In this work, we propose ParaNet, a non-autoregressive seq2seq model that converts text to spectrogram. It is fully convolutional and brings 46.7 times speed-up over its autoregressive counterpart at synthesis, while obtaining reasonably good speech quality.  ParaNet also produces stable alignment between text and speech on the challenging test sentences by iteratively improving the attention in a layer-by-layer manner.  Furthermore, we build the parallel text-to-speech system by applying various parallel neural vocoders, which can synthesize speech from text through a single feed-forward pass.  We also explore a novel approach to train the IAF-based vocoder from scratch, which avoids the need for distillation from a separately trained WaveNet.</p>

> <p>Amortized variational methods have proven difficult to scale to structured problems, such as inferring positions of multiple objects from video images. We develop amortized population Gibbs (APG) samplers, a class of scalable methods that frame structured variational inference as adaptive importance sampling. APG samplers construct high-dimensional proposals by iterating over updates to lower-dimensional blocks of variables. We train each conditional proposal by minimizing the inclusive KL divergence with respect to the conditional posterior. To appropriately account for the size of the input data, we develop a new parameterization in terms of neural sufficient statistics. Experiments show that APG samplers can be used to train highly-structured deep generative models in an unsupervised manner, and achieve substantial improvements in inference accuracy relative to standard autoencoding variational methods.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks are known to be fragile to small adversarial perturbations. This issue becomes more critical when a neural network is interconnected with a physical system in a closed loop. In this paper, we show how to combine recent works on static neural network certification tools with robust control theory to certify a neural network policy in a control loop. We give a sufficient condition and an algorithm to ensure that the closed loop state and control constraints are satisfied when the persistent adversarial perturbation is linf norm bounded. Our method is based on finding a positively invariant set of the closed loop dynamical system, and thus we do not require the continuity of the neural network policy. Along with the verification result, we also develop an effective attack strategy for neural network control systems that outperforms exhaustive Monte-Carlo search significantly. We show that our certification algorithm works well on learned models and achieves 5 times better result than the traditional Lipschitz-based method to certify the robustness of a neural network policy on multiple control problems.</p>

  Satrajit Chatterjee, Alan Mishchenko [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5901-Metadata.json)
> <p>The focus of this paper is on intrinsic methods to detect overfitting. These rely only on the model and the training data, as opposed to traditional extrinsic methods that rely on performance on a test set or on bounds from model complexity. We propose a family of intrinsic methods called Counterfactual Simulation (CFS) which analyze the flow of training examples through the model by identifying and perturbing rare patterns. By applying CFS to logic circuits we get a method that has no hyper-parameters and works uniformly across different types of models such as neural networks, random forests and lookup tables. Experimentally, CFS can separate models with different levels of overfit using only their logic circuit representations without any access to the high level structure. By comparing lookup tables, neural networks, and random forests using CFS, we get insight into why neural networks generalize. In particular, we find that stochastic gradient descent in neural nets does not lead to âbrute force" memorization, but finds common patterns (whether we train with actual or randomized labels), and neural networks are not unlike forests in this regard. Finally, we identify a limitation with our proposal that makes it unsuitable in an adversarial setting, but points the way to future work on robust intrinsic methods.</p>

> <p>Inter-domain Gaussian processes (GPs) allow for high flexibility and low computational cost when performing approximate inference in GP models. They are particularly suitable for modeling data exhibiting global function behavior but are limited to stationary covariance functions and thus fail to model non-stationary data effectively. We propose Inter-domain Deep Gaussian Processes with RKHS Fourier Features, an extension of shallow inter-domain GPs that combines the advantages of inter-domain and deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) and demonstrate how to leverage existing approximate inference approaches to perform simple and scalable approximate inference on Inter-domain Deep Gaussian Processes. We assess the performance of our method on a wide range of prediction problems and demonstrate that it outperforms inter-domain GPs and DGPs on challenging large-scale and high-dimensional real-world datasets exhibiting both global behavior as well as a high-degree of non-stationarity.</p>

> In this paper, we introduce a novel form of a value function, $Q(s, s&#x27;)$, that expresses the utility of transitioning from a state $s$ to a neighboring state $s&#x27;$ and then acting optimally thereafter. In order to derive an optimal policy, we develop a novel forward dynamics model that learns to make next-state predictions that maximize $Q(s,s&#x27;)$. This formulation decouples actions from values while still learning off-policy. We highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of value function transfer, learning within redundant action spaces, and learning off-policy from state observations generated by sub-optimal or completely random policies.

> <p>The bias of the sample means of the arms in multi-armed bandits is an important issue in adaptive data analysis that has recently received considerable attention in the literature. Existing results relate in precise ways the sign and magnitude of the bias to various sources of data adaptivity, but do not apply to the conditional inference setting in which the sample means are computed only if some specific conditions are satisfied. In this paper, we characterize the sign of the conditional bias of monotone functions of the rewards, including the sample mean. Our results hold for arbitrary conditioning events and leverage natural monotonicity properties of the data collection policy. We further demonstrate, through several examples from sequential testing and best arm identification, that the sign of the conditional and unconditional bias of the sample mean of an arm can be different, depending on the conditioning event. Our analysis offers new and interesting perspectives on the subtleties of assessing the bias in data adaptive settings.</p>

> <p>To improve the stability of GAN training we need to understand why they can produce realistic samples. Presently, this is attributed to properties of the divergence obtained under an optimal discriminator. This argument has a fundamental flaw:\ If we do not impose regularity of the discriminator, it can exploit visually imperceptible errors of the generator to always achieve the maximal generator loss. In practice, gradient penalties are used to regularize the discriminator. However, this needs a metric on the space of images that captures visual similarity.  Such a metric is not known, which explains the limited success of gradient penalties in stabilizing GANs.\ We argue that the performance of GANs is instead due to the implicit competitive regularization (ICR) arising from the simultaneous optimization of generator and discriminator. ICR promotes solutions that \emph{look real} to the discriminator and thus leverages its inductive biases to generate realistic images. We show that opponent-aware modelling of generator and discriminator, as present in competitive gradient descent (CGD), can significantly strengthen ICR and thus stabilize GAN training without explicit regularization. In our experiments, we use an existing implementation of WGAN-GP and show that by training it with CGD we can improve the inception score (IS) on CIFAR10 for a wide range of scenarios, without any hyperparameter tuning. The highest IS is obtained by combining CGD with the WGAN-loss, without any explicit regularization.</p>

  Michihiro Yasunaga, Percy Liang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5912-Metadata.json)
> <p>We consider the problem of learning to repair programs from diagnostic feedback (e.g., compiler error messages). Program repair is challenging for two reasons: First, it requires reasoning and tracking symbols across source code and diagnostic feedback. Second, labeled datasets available for program repair are relatively small. In this work, we propose novel solutions to these two challenges. First, we introduce a program-feedback graph, which connects symbols relevant to program repair in source code and diagnostic feedback, and then apply a graph neural network on top to model the reasoning process. Second, we present a self-supervised learning paradigm for program repair that leverages unlabeled programs available online to create a large amount of extra program repair examples, which we use to pre-train our models. We evaluate our proposed approach on two applications: correcting introductory programming assignments (DeepFix dataset) and correcting the outputs of program synthesis (SPoC dataset). Our final system, DrRepair, significantly outperforms prior work, achieving 68.2\% full repair rate on DeepFix (+22.9\% over the prior best), and 48.4\% synthesis success rate on SPoC (+3.7\% over the prior best).</p>

> <p>Off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning offers the chance of using observational data to improve future outcomes in domains such as healthcare and education, but safe deployment in high stakes settings requires ways of assessing its validity. Traditional measures such as confidence intervals may be insufficient due to noise, limited data and confounding. In this paper we develop a method that could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human experts to analyze the validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is accomplished by highlighting observations in the data whose removal will have a large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating a set of rules for choosing which ones to present to domain experts for validation. We develop methods to compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation with two different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares. Experiments on medical simulations and real-world intensive care unit data demonstrate that our method can be used to identify limitations in the evaluation process and make evaluation more robust.</p>

> <p>Existing approaches to federated learning suffer from a communication bottleneck as well as convergence issues due to sparse client participation. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called FedSketchedSGD, to overcome these challenges. FedSketchedSGD compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design of FedSketchedSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch. This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates. We prove that FedSketchedSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and a transformer model.</p>

> <p>As the operations of autonomous systems generally affect simultaneously several users, it is crucial that their designs account for fairness considerations. In contrast to standard (deep) reinforcement learning (RL), we investigate the problem of learning a policy that treats its users equitably. In this paper, we formulate this novel RL problem, in which an objective function (generalized Gini index of utility vectors), which encodes a notion of fairness that we formally define, is optimized. For this problem, we provide a theoretical discussion where we examine the case of discounted rewards and that of average rewards. During this analysis, we notably derive a new result in the standard RL setting, which is of independent interest: it states a novel bound on the approximation error with respect to the optimal average reward of that of a policy optimal for the discounted reward. Since learning with discounted rewards is generally easier, this discussion further justifies finding a fair policy for the average reward by learning a fair policy for the discounted reward. Thus, we describe how several classic deep RL algorithms can be adapted to our fair optimization problem. Finally, we validate our approach with extensive experiments in three different domains.</p>

> <p>As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, there has been a growing interest in developing post hoc explanations that summarize the behaviors of these black box models. However, existing algorithms for generating such explanations have been shown to lack robustness with respect to shifts in the underlying data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating robust explanations of black box models based on adversarial training. In particular, our framework optimizes a minimax objective that aims to construct the highest fidelity explanation with respect to the worst-case over a set of distribution shifts. We instantiate this algorithm for explanations in the form of linear models and decision sets by devising the required optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this work makes the first attempt at generating post hoc explanations that are robust to a general class of distribution shifts that are of practical interest. Experimental evaluation with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our approach substantially improves the robustness of explanations without sacrificing their fidelity on the original data distribution.</p>

> <p>In distributed online optimization over a computing network with heterogeneous nodes, slow nodes can adversely affect the progress of fast nodes, leading to drastic slowdown of the overall convergence process. To address this issue, we consider a new algorithm termed Distributed Any-Batch Mirror Descent (DABMD), which is based on distributed Mirror Descent but uses a fixed per-round computing time to limit the waiting by fast nodes to receive information updates from slow nodes. DABMD is characterized by varying minibatch sizes across nodes. It is applicable to a broader range of problems compared with existing distributed online optimization methods such as those based on dual averaging, and it accommodates time-varying network topology. We study two versions of DABMD, depending on whether the computing nodes average their primal variables via single or multiple consensus iterations. We show that both versions provide strong theoretical performance guarantee, by deriving upperbounds on their expected dynamic regret, which capture the variability in minibatch sizes. Our experimental results show substantial reduction in cost and acceleration in convergence compared with the known best alternative.</p>

> Key problems arising in web applications (with millions of users and thousands of items) can be formulated as Linear Programs (LP) involving billions to trillions of decision variables and constraints. Despite the appeal of LP formulations, solving problems at these scales is well beyond the capabilities of existing LP solvers. Often ad-hoc decomposition rules are used to approximately solve these LPs, which have limited optimality guarantees and lead to sub-optimal performance in practice. In this work, we propose a distributed solver that solves a perturbation of the LP problems at scale. We propose a gradient-based algorithm on the smooth dual of the perturbed LP with computational guarantees. The main workhorses of our algorithm are distributed matrix-vector multiplications (with load balancing) and efficient projection operations on distributed machines. Experiments on real-world data show that our proposed LP solver, ECLIPSE, can solve problems with $10^{12}$ decision variables -- well beyond the capabilities of current solvers.

> <p>Reinforcement Learning for control tasks where the agent learns from raw high dimensional pixels has proven to be difficult and sample-inefficient.  Operating on high-dimensional observational input poses a challenging credit assignment problem, which hinders the agentâs ability to learn optimal policies quickly. One promising approach to improve the sample efficiency of image-based RL algorithms is to learn low-dimensional representations from the raw input using unsupervised learning. To that end, we propose a new model: Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning (CURL). CURL extracts high level features from raw pixels using a contrastive learning objective and performs off-policy control on top of the extracted features. CURL achieves state-of-the-art performance and is the first image based algorithm across both model-free and model-based settings to nearly match the sample-efficiency and performance of state-based features on five out of the six DeepMind control benchmarks.</p>

> <p>Despite the power of deep neural networks for a wide range of tasks, an overconfident prediction issue has limited their practical use in many safety-critical applications. Many recent works have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but most of them require either additional computational costs in training and/or inference phases or customized architectures to output confidence estimates separately. In this paper, we propose a method of training deep neural networks with a novel loss function, named Correctness Ranking Loss, which regularizes class probabilities explicitly to be better confidence estimates in terms of ordinal ranking according to confidence. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to the existing architectures without any modification. Also, it has almost the same computational costs for training as conventional deep classifiers and outputs reliable predictions by a single inference. Extensive experimental results on classification benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method helps networks to produce well-ranked confidence estimates. We also demonstrate that it is effective for the tasks closely related to confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection and active learning.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we present a Bayesian Moment Matching (BMM) based method aimed at solving the initialization problem in Boolean SAT solvers.  The initialization problem can be stated as follows: given a SAT formula Ï, compute an initial order over the variables of Ï and values/polarity for these variables such that the runtime of SAT solvers on input Ï is minimized. At the start of a solver run, our BMM-based methods compute a posterior probability distribution for an assign- ment to the variables of the input formula after analyzing its clauses. This probability distribution is then used by the solver to initialize its search.  We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our BMM-based heuristic against 4 other initialization methods (random, survey propagation, Jeroslow-Wang, and default) in state-of-the-art solvers, MapleCOMSPS and MapleLCMDistChronotBT over the SAT competition 2018 application benchmark, as well as the best-known solvers in the cryptographic category, namely, CryptoMiniSAT, Glucose and MapleSAT.  On the cryptographic benchmark, BMM-based solvers out-perform all other initialization methods. Further, the BMM-based MapleCOMSPS significantly out-perform the same solver using all other initialization methods by 12 additional instances solved and better average runtime, over the SAT 2018 competition benchmark.</p>  <p>We performed extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our BMM-based heuristics on SAT competition 2018 application and hard cryptographic benchmarks. We implemented our heuristics in state-of-the-art solvers (MapleCOMSPS and MapleLCMDistChronotBT for SAT competition 2018 application benchmarks) and CryptoMiniSAT, Glucose and MapleSAT (in the context of cryptographic benchmarks), against 4 other initialization methods. Our solvers out-perform the baselines by solving 12 more instances from the SAT competition 2018 application benchmark and are %40 faster on average in solving hard cryptographic instances.</p>

> <p>Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product.  The vast number of possible chemical transformations makes the size of the search space very big, and retrosynthetic planning is challenging even for experienced chemists. However, existing methods either require expensive return estimation by rollout with high variance, or optimize for search speed rather than the quality.  In this paper, we propose Retro<em>, a neural-based A</em>-like algorithm that finds high-quality synthetic routes efficiently. It maintains the search as an AND-OR tree, and learns a neural search bias with off-policy data. Then guided by this neural network, it performs best first search efficiently during new planning episode. Experiments on  benchmark USPTO datasets show that, our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art with respect to both the success rate and solution quality, while being more efficient at the same time.</p>

> <p>Communication cost is often a bottleneck in federated learning and other client-based distributed learning scenarios. To overcome this, several gradient compression and model compression algorithms have been proposed. In this work, we propose an alternative approach whereby an ensemble of pre-trained base predictors is trained via federated learning. This method allows for training a model which may otherwise surpass the communication bandwidth and storage capacity of the clients to be learned with on-device data through federated learning. Motivated by language modeling, we prove the optimality of ensemble methods for density estimation for standard empirical risk minimization and agnostic risk minimization. We provide communication-efficient ensemble algorithms for federated learning, where per-round communication cost is independent of the size of the ensemble. Furthermore, unlike works on gradient compression, our proposed approach reduces the communication cost of both server-to-client and client-to-server communication.</p>

> Datasets containing sensitive information are often sequentially analyzed by many algorithms and, accordingly, a fundamental question in differential privacy is concerned with how the overall privacy bound degrades under composition. To address this question, we introduce a family of analytical and sharp privacy bounds under composition using the Edgeworth expansion in the framework of the recently proposed $f$-differential privacy. In short, whereas the existing composition theorem, for example, relies on the central limit theorem, our new privacy bounds under composition gain improved tightness by leveraging the refined approximation accuracy of the Edgeworth expansion. Our approach is easy to implement and computationally efficient for any number of compositions. The superiority of these new bounds is confirmed by an asymptotic error analysis and an application to quantifying the overall privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent used in training private deep neural networks.

> <p>Weak supervision is a popular method for building machine learning models without relying on ground truth annotations. Instead, it generates probabilistic training labels by estimating the accuracies of multiple noisy labeling sources (e.g., heuristics, crowd workers). Existing approaches use latent variable estimation to model the noisy sources, but these methods can be computationally expensive, scaling superlinearly in the data. In this work, we show that, for a class of latent variable models highly applicable to weak supervision, we can find a closed-form solution to model parameters, obviating the need for iterative solutions like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We use this insight to build FlyingSquid, a weak supervision framework that runs orders of magnitude faster than previous weak supervision approaches and requires fewer assumptions. In particular, we prove bounds on generalization error without assuming that the latent variable model can exactly parameterize the underlying data distribution. Empirically, we validate FlyingSquid on benchmark weak supervision datasets and find that it achieves the same or higher quality compared to previous approaches without the need to tune an SGD procedure, recovers model parameters 170 times faster on average, and enables new video analysis and online learning applications.</p>

> <p>We develop a novel variant of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which we call spectral Frank-Wolfe, for convex optimization over a spectrahedron. The spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm has a novel ingredient: it computes a few eigenvectors of the gradient and solves a small-scale subproblem in each iteration. Such a procedure overcomes the slow convergence of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm due to ignoring eigenvalue coalescence. We demonstrate that strict complementarity of the optimization problem is key to proving linear convergence of various algorithms, such as the spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm as well as the projected gradient method and its accelerated version. We showcase that the strict complementarity is equivalent to the eigengap assumption on the gradient at the optimal solution considered in the literature. As a byproduct of this observation, we also develop a generalized block Frank-Wolfe algorithm and prove its linear convergence.</p>

  Marko Vasic, Cameron Chalk, Sarfraz Khurshid, David Soloveichik [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6017-Metadata.json)
> <p>Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology, medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (Binary-weight ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on widely used IRIS and MNIST datasets. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.</p>

> <p>Inspired by progress in unsupervised representation learning for natural language, we examine whether similar models can learn useful representations for images. We train a sequence Transformer to auto-regressively predict pixels, without incorporating knowledge of the 2D input structure. Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet without labels, we find that a GPT-2 scale model learns strong image representations as measured by linear probing, fine-tuning, and low-data classification. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3% accuracy with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised Wide ResNet, and 99.0% accuracy with full fine-tuning, matching the top supervised pre-trained models. We are also competitive with self-supervised benchmarks on ImageNet when substituting pixels for a VQVAE encoding, achieving 69.0% top-1 accuracy on a linear probe of our features.</p>

> <p>Despite recent advancements in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-network (DQN) models still show lackluster performance on problems with high-dimensional action spaces. The problem is even more pronounced for cases with high-dimensional continuous action spaces due to a combinatorial increase in the number of the outputs.  Recent works approach the problem by dividing the network into multiple parallel or sequential (action) modules responsible for different discretized actions.  However, there are drawbacks to both the parallel and the sequential approaches. Parallel module architectures lack coordination between action modules, leading to extra complexity in the task, while a sequential structure can result in the vanishing gradients problem and exploding parameter space.  In this work, we show that the compositional structure of the action modules has a significant impact on model performance. We propose a novel approach to infer the network structure for DQN models operating with high-dimensional continuous actions. Our method is based on the uncertainty estimation techniques introduced in the paper. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MuJoCo environments with high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improvement of the introduced approach on a realistic AAA sailing simulator game.</p>

> <p>We study the linear subspace fitting problem in the overparameterized setting, where the estimated subspace can perfectly interpolate the training examples. Our scope includes the least-squares solutions to subspace fitting tasks with varying levels of supervision in the training data (i.e., the proportion of input-output examples of the desired low-dimensional mapping) and orthonormality of the vectors defining the learned operator. This flexible family of problems connects standard, unsupervised subspace fitting that enforces strict orthonormality with a corresponding regression task that is fully supervised and does not constrain the linear operator structure. This class of problems is defined over a supervision-orthonormality plane, where each coordinate induces a problem instance with a unique pair of supervision level and softness of orthonormality constraints. We explore this plane and show that the generalization errors of the corresponding subspace fitting problems follow double descent trends as the settings become more supervised and less orthonormally constrained. </p>

> <p>Studying the set of exact solutions of a system of polynomial equations largely depends on a single iterative algorithm, known as Buchbergerâs algorithm. Optimized versions of this algorithm are crucial for many computer algebra systems (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, Sage). We introduce a new approach to Buchbergerâs algorithm that uses reinforcement learning agents to perform S-pair selection, a key step in the algorithm. We then study how the difficulty of the problem depends on the choices of domain and distribution of polynomials, about which little is known. Finally, we train a policy model using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to learn S-pair selection strategies for random systems of binomial equations. In certain domains, the trained model outperforms state-of-the-art selection heuristics both in number of iterations of the algorithm and total number of polynomial additions performed. These results provide a proof-of-concept that recent developments in machine learning have the potential to improve performance of algorithms in symbolic computation.</p>

  Miles Lopes, Jessie X.T. Chen [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6067-Metadata.json)
> <p>Randomized Newton methods have recently become the focus of intense research activity in large-scale and distributed optimization. Generally, these methods are based on a "computation-accuracy trade-off", which allows the user to gain scalability in exchange for error in the solution. However, the user does not know how much error is created by the randomization, which can be detrimental in two ways: On one hand, the user may try to manage the unknown error with theoretical worst-case error bounds, but this approach is impractical when the bounds involve unknown constants, and it typically leads to excessive computation. On the other hand, the user may select tuning parameters or stopping criteria in a heuristic manner, but this is generally unreliable. Motivated by these difficulties, we develop a bootstrap method for directly estimating the unknown error, which avoids excessive computation and offers greater reliability. Also, we provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees to show that the error estimates are valid for several error metrics and algorithms (including GIANT and Newton Sketch). Lastly, we show that the proposed method adds relatively little cost to existing randomized Newton methods, and that it performs well in a range of experimental conditions.</p>

> <p>Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on large datasets has developed rapidly in recent years. However, the underlying methods are generally limited to relatively simple settings where the data have specific forms of independence. We propose a novel technique for speeding up MCMC for time series data by efficient data subsampling in the frequency domain. For several challenging time series models, we demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude while incurring negligible bias compared to MCMC on the full dataset. We also propose alternative control variates for variance reduction based on data grouping and coreset constructions.</p>

> <p>Partial-label learning is one of the important weakly supervised learning problems, where each training example is equipped with a set of candidate labels that contains the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed learning objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in specific manners, making their computational complexity a bottleneck for scaling up to big data. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework of partial-label learning without implicit assumptions on the model or optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a general estimator of the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and establish an estimation error bound. We then explore a progressive identification method for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator, where the update of the model and identification of true labels can be conducted in a seamless manner. The resulting algorithm is model-independent and loss-independent, and compatible with stochastic optimization. Thorough experiments demonstrate it sets the new state of the art.</p>

> <p>This paper presents a recursive reasoning formalism of Bayesian optimization (BO) to model the reasoning process in the interactions between boundedly rational, self-interested agents with unknown, complex, and costly-to-evaluate payoff functions in repeated games, which we call Recursive Reasoning-Based BO (R2-B2). Our R2-B2 algorithm is general in that it does not constrain the relationship among the payoff functions of different agents and can thus be applied to various types of games such as constant-sum, general-sum, and common-payoff games. We prove that by reasoning at level 2 or more and at one level higher than the other agents, our R2-B2 agent can achieve faster asymptotic convergence to no regret than that without utilizing recursive reasoning. We also propose a computationally cheaper variant of R2-B2 called R2-B2-Lite at the expense of a weaker convergence guarantee. The performance and generality of our R2-B2 algorithm are empirically demonstrated using synthetic games, adversarial machine learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</p>

  Hoang Nguyen, Takanori Maehara [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6084-Metadata.json)
> In this paper, we study the graph classification problem from the graph homomorphism perspective. We consider the homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$, where $G$ is a graph of interest (e.g. molecules or social networks) and $F$ belongs to some family of graphs (e.g. paths or non-isomorphic trees). We proved that graph homomorphism numbers provide a natural universally invariant embedding maps which can be used for graph classifications. We also discovered that the graph homomorphism method unifies connectivity preserving methods. In practice, by observing that graph classification datasets often have bounded treewidths, we show that our method is not only competitive in classification accuracy but also run much faster than other state-of-the-art. Finally, based on our theoretical analysis, we propose the Graph Homomorphism Convolution module which has promising performance in the graph classification task.

  Heewoo Jun, Rewon Child, Mark Chen, John Schulman, Aditya Ramesh, Alec Radford, Ilya Sutskever [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6095-Metadata.json)
> <p>We present conditional augmentation (CondAugment), a simple and powerful method of regularizing generative models. Core to our approach is applying augmentation functions to data and then conditioning the generative model on the specific function used. Unlike typical data augmentation, CondAugment allows usage of functions which modify the target density, enabling aggressive augmentations more commonly seen in supervised and self-supervised learning. We demonstrate this is a more effective regularizer than standard methods, and use it to train a 150M parameter autoregressive model on CIFAR-10 to 2.56 bits per dim (relative to the state-of-the-art 2.80). Samples from this model attain FID 12.75 and IS 8.40, outperforming the majority of GANs. We further demonstrate the technique is broadly applicable across model architectures, objectives, and problem domains.</p>

> <p>Recent research has shown that incorporating equivariance into neural network architectures is very helpful, and there have been some works investigating the equivariance of networks under group actions. However, as digital images and feature maps are on the discrete meshgrid, corresponding equivariance-preserving transformation groups are very limited.  In this work, we deal with this issue from the connection between convolutions and partial differential operators (PDOs). In theory, assuming inputs to be smooth, we transform PDOs and propose a system which is equivariant to a much more general continuous group, the n-dimension Euclidean group. In implementation, we discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving approximately equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the approximation error of PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first time that the error analysis is provided when the equivariance is approximate. Extensive experiments on rotated MNIST and natural image classification show that PDO-eConvs perform competitively yet use parameters much more efficiently. Particularly, compared with Wide ResNets, our methods result in comparable results using only 12.6% parameters.</p>

> <p>A longstanding problem for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is understanding their puzzling ability to generalize well. We approach this problem through the unconventional angle of \textit{cognitive abstraction mechanisms}, drawing inspiration from recent neuroscience work, allowing us to define the Cognitive Neural Activation metric (CNA) for DNNs, which is the correlation between information complexity (entropy) of given input and the concentration of higher activation values in deeper layers of the network. The CNA is highly predictive of generalization ability, outperforming norm-and-margin-based generalization metrics on an extensive evaluation of over 100 dataset-and-network-architecture combinations, especially in cases where additive noise is present and/or training labels are corrupted. These strong empirical results show the usefulness of CNA as a generalization metric, and encourage further research on the connection between information complexity and representations in the deeper layers of networks in order to better understand the generalization capabilities of DNNs.</p>

> <p>Experience replay is central to off-policy algorithms in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but there remain significant gaps in our understanding. We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay - greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counter-intuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure the importance across three deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.</p>

> <p>We propose an efficient algorithm to train  a very deep and thin network with theoretic guarantee. Our method is motivated by model compression, and consists of three stages. In the first stage, we widen the deep thin network and train it until convergence. In the second stage, we use this well trained deep wide network to warm up or initialize the original deep thin network. In the last stage, we train this well initialized deep thin network until convergence. The key ingredient of our method is  its second stage, in which the thin network is gradually warmed up by imitating the intermediate outputs of the wide network from bottom to top. We establish theoretical guarantee using mean field analysis. We show that our method is provably more efficient than directly training a deep thin network from scratch. We also conduct empirical evaluations on image classification and language modeling. By training with our approach, ResNet50 can outperform  ResNet101 which is normally trained as in the literature, and BERT<em>BASE can be comparable with BERT</em>LARGE. </p>

> In modern supervised learning, there are a large number of tasks, but many of them are associated with only a small amount of labelled data. These include data from medical image processing and robotic interaction. Even though each individual task cannot be meaningfully trained in isolation, one seeks to meta-learn across the tasks from past experiences by exploiting some similarities. We study a fundamental question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for such a graceful exchange to hold; there is little loss in sample complexity even when we only have access to small data tasks. To this end, we introduce a novel spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with  $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples.

> <p>We propose a unified framework for adaptive connection sampling in graph neural  networks (GNNs) that generalizes existing stochastic regularization methods for  training GNNs. The proposed framework not only alleviates over-smoothing and  over-fitting tendencies of deep GNNs, but also enables learning with uncertainty in graph analytic tasks with GNNs. Instead of using fixed sampling rates or hand-tuning themas model hyperparameters in existing stochastic regularization methods, our adaptive connection sampling can be trained jointly with GNN model parameters in both global and local fashions. GNN training with adaptive connection sampling is shown to be mathematically equivalent to an efficient approximation of training BayesianGNNs. Experimental results with ablation studies on benchmark datasets validate that adaptively learning the sampling rate given graph training data is the key to boost the performance of GNNs in semi-supervised node classification, less prone to over-smoothing and over-fitting with more robust prediction.</p>

> <p>We study the properties of a leave-node-out jackknife procedure for network data.  Under the sparse graphon model, we prove an Efron-Stein-type inequality, showing that the network jackknife leads to conservative estimates of the variance (in expectation) for any network functional that is invariant to node permutation.  For a general class of count functionals, we also establish consistency of the network jackknife.  We complement our theoretical analysis with a range of simulated and real-data examples and show that the network jackknife offers competitive performance in cases where other resampling methods are known to be valid. In fact, for several network statistics, we see that the jackknife provides more accurate inferences compared to related methods such as subsampling.</p>

> <p>Thompson sampling is an efficient algorithm for sequential decision making, which exploits the posterior uncertainty to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. There has been significant recent interest in integrating  Bayesian neural networks into Thompson sampling. Most of these methods rely on global variable uncertainty for exploration. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic modeling framework for Thompson sampling, where local latent variable uncertainty is used to sample the mean reward. Variational inference is used to approximate the posterior of the local variable, and semi-implicit structure is further introduced to enhance its expressiveness. Our experimental results on eight  contextual bandits benchmark datasets show that Thompson sampling guided by local uncertainty achieves state-of-the-art performance while having low computational complexity.</p>

> <p>We consider the use of decision trees for decision-making problems under the predict-then-optimize framework. That is, we would like to first use a decision tree to predict unknown input parameters of an optimization problem, and then make decisions by solving the optimization problem using the predicted parameters. A natural loss function in this framework is to measure the suboptimality of the decisions induced by the predicted input parameters, as opposed to measuring loss using input parameter prediction error. This natural loss function is known in the literature as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss, and we propose a tractable methodology called SPO Trees (SPOTs) for training decision trees under this loss. SPOTs benefit from the interpretability of decision trees, providing an interpretable segmentation of contextual features into groups with distinct optimal solutions to the optimization problem of interest. We conduct several numerical experiments on synthetic and real data including the prediction of travel times for shortest path problems and predicting click probabilities for news article recommendation. We demonstrate on these datasets that SPOTs simultaneously provide higher quality decisions and significantly lower model complexity than other machine learning approaches (e.g., CART) trained to minimize prediction error.</p>

> <p>In this paper, we study the problem of learning compact (low-dimensional) representations for sequential data that captures its implicit spatio-temporal cues. To maximize extraction of such informative cues from the data, we set the problem within the context of contrastive representation learning and to that end propose a novel objective via optimal transport. Specifically, our formulation seeks a low-dimensional subspace representation of the data that jointly (i) maximizes the distance of the data (embedded in this subspace) from an adversarial data distribution under the optimal transport, a.k.a. the Wasserstein distance, (ii) captures the temporal order, and (iii) minimizes the data distortion. To generate the adversarial distribution, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with novel regularizers. Our full objective can be cast as a subspace learning problem on the Grassmann manifold, and can be solved efficiently via Riemannian optimization. To empirically study our formulation, we provide elaborate experiments on the task of human action recognition in video sequences. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against challenging baselines.</p>

> <p>Visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) require an interplay of visual perception with reasoning about the question semantics grounded in perception. Challenges like VCR (Zellers et al., 2019) and GQA (Hudson&amp; Manning, 2019) facilitate scientific progress from perception models to visual reasoning. However, recent advances on GQA are still primarily driven by perception improvements (e.g.  scene graph generation) rather than reasoning. Neuro-symbolic models such as MAC (Hudson&amp; Manning, 2018) bring the benefits of compositional reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning, and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own.</p>  <p>To address this, we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this end, we introduce a differentiable first-order logic formalism for VQA that explicitly decouples question answering from visual perception. On the challenging GQA dataset, this approach is competitive with non-symbolic neural models while also interpretable by construction, composable with arbitrary pre-trained visual representation learning, and requires much fewer parameters.</p>

> <p>Individual fairness was proposed to address some of the shortcomings of group fairness. Despite its benefits, it requires a task specific fairness metric that encodes our intuition of what is fair and what is unfair for the ML task at hand. Ambiguity in this metric is the main barrier to wider adoption of individual fairness. In this paper, we present two simple algorithms that learn effective fair metrics from a variety of datasets. We verify empirically that fair training with these metrics leads to improved fairness on three machine learning tasks susceptible to gender and racial biases. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the statistical performance of both approaches. </p>

> <p>This paper presents a simple framework for contrastive representation learning. The framework, SimCLR, simplifies recently proposed approaches and requires neither specific architectural modifications nor a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction task to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components in the framework. We empirically show that 1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining the predictive tasks that enable effective representation learning, 2) introducing a learned nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the representation, and 3) contrastive learning benefits from a larger batch size and more training steps compared to the supervised counterpart. By combining our findings, we improve considerably over previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on the representation of our best model achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art. When fine-tuned on 1% of labels, our model achieves 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.</p>

> <p>Dropout is a widely-used regularization technique, often required to obtain state-of-the-art for a number of architectures. This work observes that dropout introduces two distinct but entangled regularization effects: an explicit effect which occurs since dropout modifies the expected training objective, and an implicit effect from stochasticity in the dropout gradients. We disentangle these two effects, deriving analytic simplifications which characterize each effect in terms of the derivatives of the model and loss. Our simplified regularizers accurately capture the important aspects of dropout: we demonstrate that they can faithfully replace dropout in practice.</p>

> <p>Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the "plug and play" nature of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with a single trained model, eliminating the need to train and store multiple models for different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.</p>

  Chengcheng Wan, Henry (Hank) Hoffmann, Shan Lu, Michael Maire [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6169-Metadata.json)
> <p>We propose a novel variant of SGD customized for training network architectures that support anytime behavior: such networks produce a series of increasingly accurate outputs over time.  Efficient architectural designs for these networks focus on re-using internal state; subnetworks must produce representations relevant for both immediate prediction as well as refinement by subsequent network stages.  We consider traditional branched networks as well as a new class of recursively nested networks. Our new optimizer, Orthogonalized SGD, dynamically re-balances task-specific gradients when training a multitask network.  In the context of anytime architectures, this optimizer projects gradients from later outputs onto a parameter subspace that does not interfere with those from earlier outputs.  Experiments demonstrate that training with Orthogonalized SGD significantly improves generalization accuracy of anytime networks.</p>

> <p>We perform an in-depth evaluation of human accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. First, three expert labelers re-annotated 30,000 images from the original ImageNet validation set and the ImageNetV2 replication experiment with multi-label annotations to enable a semantically coherent accuracy measurement. Then we evaluated five trained humans on both datasets. The median of the five labelers outperforms the best publicly released ImageNet model by 1.5% on the original validation set and by 6.2% on ImageNetV2. Moreover, the human labelers see a substantially smaller drop in accuracy between the two datasets compared to the best available model (less than 1% vs 5.4%). Our results put claims of superhuman performance on ImageNet in context and show that robustly classifying ImageNet at human-level performance is still an open problem.</p>

> <p>Over the last decade, there has been significant progress in the field of machine learning-based de novo drug discovery, particularly in generative modeling of chemical structures. However, current generative approaches exhibit a significant challenge: they do not ensure the synthetic accessibility nor provide the synthetic routes of the proposed small molecules which limits their applicability. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) setup for drug discovery that addresses this challenge by embedding the concept of synthetic accessibility directly into the de novo compound design system. In this setup, the agent learns to navigate through the immense synthetically accessible chemical space by subjecting initial commercially available molecules to valid chemical reactions at every time step of the iterative virtual synthesis process. The proposed environment for drug discovery provides a highly challenging test-bed for RL algorithms owing to the large state space and high-dimensional continuous action space with hierarchical actions. Our end-to-end approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared against other generative approaches for drug discovery. Moreover, we leverage our approach in a proof-of-concept that mimics the drug discovery process by generating novel HIV drug candidates. Finally, we describe how the end-to-end training conceptualized in this study represents an important paradigm in radically expanding the synthesizable chemical space and automating the drug discovery process.</p>

> We study the classical problem of forecasting under logarithmic loss while competing against an arbitrary class of experts. We present a novel approach to bounding the minimax regret that exploits the self-concordance property of logarithmic loss. Our regret bound depends on the metric entropy of the expert class and matches previous best known results for arbitrary expert classes. We improve the dependence on the time horizon for classes with metric entropy under the supremum norm of order $\Omega(\gamma^{-p})$ when $p&gt;1$, which includes, for example, Lipschitz functions of dimension greater than 1.

> <p>The current paradigm of deep neural networks has been successful in part due to the use of normalization layers. Normalization layers like Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization and Weight Normalization are ubiquitous in practice as they improve the generalization performance and training speed of neural networks significantly. Nonetheless, the vast majority of current deep learning theory and non-convex optimization literature focuses on the un-normalized setting.  We bridge this gap by providing the first global convergence result for 2 layer non-linear neural networks with ReLU activations trained with a normalization layer, namely Weight Normalization. The analysis shows how the introduction of normalization layers changes the optimization landscape and in some settings enables faster convergence as compared with un-normalized neural networks. </p>

> <p>Generative models in molecular design tend to be richly parameterized, data-hungry neural models, as they must create complex structured objects as outputs. Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in absolute gain.</p>

> <p>Recent years have witnessed intensive research interests on training deep neural networks (DNNs) more efficiently by quantization-based compression methods, which facilitate DNNs training in two ways: (1) activations are quantized to shrink the memory consumption, and (2) gradients are quantized to decrease the communication cost. However, existing methods mostly use a uniform mechanism that quantizes the values evenly. Such a scheme may cause a large quantization variance and slow down the convergence in practice.</p>  <p>In this work, we introduce TinyScript, which applies a non-uniform quantization algorithm to both activations and gradients. TinyScript models the original values by a family of Weibull distributions and searches for ''quantization knobs'' that minimize quantization variance. We also discuss the convergence of the non-uniform quantization algorithm on DNNs with varying depths, shedding light on the number of bits required for convergence. Experiments show that TinyScript always obtains lower quantization variance, and achieves comparable model qualities against full precision training using 1-2 bits less than the uniform-based counterpart.</p>

> We study the robust one-bit compressed sensing problem whose goal is to design an algorithm that faithfully recovers any sparse target vector $\theta_0\in\mathbb{R}^d$  \textit{uniformly} via $m$ quantized noisy measurements. Specifically, we consider a new framework for this problem where the sparsity is implicitly enforced via mapping a low dimensional representation $x_0 \in \RR^k$  through a known $n$-layer ReLU generative network $G:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\theta_0 = G(x_0)$.  Such a framework poses low-dimensional priors on $\theta_0$ without a known sparsity basis. We propose to recover the target $G(x_0)$ solving an unconstrained empirical risk minimization (ERM). Under a weak \textit{sub-exponential measurement assumption}, we establish a joint statistical and computational analysis. In particular, we prove that the ERM estimator in this new framework achieves a statistical rate of $m=\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(kn \log d /\varepsilon^2)$ recovering any $G(x_0)$ uniformly up to an error $\varepsilon$. When the network is shallow (i.e., $n$ is small), we show this rate matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithm factors on $\varepsilon^{-1}$. From the lens of computation, we prove that under proper conditions on the ReLU weights, our proposed empirical risk, despite non-convexity, has no stationary point outside of small neighborhoods around the true representation $x_0$ and its negative multiple. Furthermore, we show that the global minimizer of the empirical risk stays within the neighborhood around $x_0$ rather than its negative multiple under further assumptions on ReLU weights.

> <p>This paper studies an entropy-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO). The entropy search is successful approach to Bayesian optimization. However, for MBO, existing entropy-based methods ignore trade-off among objectives or introduce unreliable approximations. We propose a novel entropy-based MBO called Pareto-frontier entropy search (PFES) by considering the entropy of Pareto-frontier, which is an essential notion of the optimality of the multi-objective problem. Our entropy can incorporate the trade-off relation of the optimal values, and further, we derive an analytical formula without introducing additional approximations or simplifications to the standard entropy search setting. We also show that our entropy computation is practically feasible by using a recursive decomposition technique which has been known in studies of the Pareto hyper-volume computation. Besides the usual MBO setting, in which all the objectives are simultaneously observed, we also consider the ``decoupled'' setting, in which the objective functions can be observed separately. PFES can easily adapt to the decoupled setting by considering the entropy of the marginal density for each output dimension. This approach incorporates dependency among objectives conditioned on Pareto-frontier, which is ignored by the existing method. Our numerical experiments show effectiveness of PFES through several benchmark datasets.</p>

> Stochastic gradient descent without replacement sampling is widely used in practice for model training. However, the vast majority of SGD analyses assumes data sampled with replacement, and when the function minimized is strongly convex, an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ rate can be established when SGD is run for $T$ iterations. A recent line of breakthrough work on SGD without replacement (SGDo) established an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{T^2}\right)$ convergence rate when the function minimized is strongly convex and is a sum of $n$ smooth functions, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}+\frac{n^3}{T^3}\right)$ rate for sums of quadratics. On the other hand, the tightest known lower bound postulates an $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{T^2}+\frac{n^2}{T^3}\right)$ rate, leaving open the possibility of better SGDo convergence rates in the general case. In this paper, we close this gap and show that SGD without replacement achieves a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}+\frac{n^2}{T^3}\right)$ when the sum of the functions is a quadratic, and offer a new lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{T^2}\right)$ for strongly convex functions that are sums of smooth functions.

> In many practical applications, heuristic or approximation algorithms are used to efficiently solve the task at hand. However their solutions frequently do not satisfy natural monotonicity properties expected to hold in the optimum. In this work we develop algorithms that are able to restore monotonicity in the parameters of interest.  Specifically, given oracle access to a possibly non monotone function,  we provide an algorithm that restores monotonicity while degrading the expected value of the function by at most $\epsilon$. The number of queries required is at most logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$ and exponential in the number of parameters. We also give a lower bound showing that this exponential dependence is necessary.  Finally, we obtain improved query complexity bounds for restoring the weaker property of $k$-marginal monotonicity. Under this property, every $k$-dimensional projection of the function is required to be monotone. The query complexity we obtain only scales exponentially with $k$ and is polynomial in the number of parameters.

> <p>Identifying algorithms that flexibly and efficiently discover temporally-extended multi-phase plans is an essential step for the advancement of robotics and model-based reinforcement learning. The core problem of long-range planning is finding an efficient way to search through the tree of possible action sequences. Existing non-learned planning solutions from the Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) literature rely on the existence of logical descriptions for the effects and preconditions for actions. This constraint allows TAMP methods to efficiently reduce the tree search problem but limits their ability to generalize to unseen and complex physical environments. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods use flexible neural-network-based function approximators to discover policies that generalize naturally to unseen circumstances. However, DRL methods struggle to handle the very sparse reward landscapes inherent to long-range multi-step planning situations. Here, we propose the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), which fuses elements of TAMP and DRL by combining a curiosity-guided sampling strategy with imitation learning to accelerate planning. We show that CSP can efficiently discover interesting and complex temporally-extended plans for solving a wide range of physically realistic 3D tasks. In contrast, standard planning and learning methods often fail to solve these tasks at all or do so only with a huge and highly variable number of training samples. We explore the use of a variety of curiosity metrics with CSP and analyze the types of solutions that CSP discovers. Finally, we show that CSP supports task transfer so that the exploration policies learned during experience with one task can help improve efficiency on related tasks.</p>

> The goal of Sparse Convex Optimization is to optimize a convex function $f$ under a sparsity constraint $s\leq s^*\gamma$, where $s^*$ is the target number of non-zero entries in a feasible solution (sparsity) and $\gamma\geq 1$ is an approximation factor. There has been a lot of work to analyze the sparsity guarantees of various algorithms (LASSO, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)) in terms of the Restricted Condition Number $\kappa$. The best known algorithms guarantee to find an approximate solution of value $f(x^*)+\epsilon$ with the sparsity bound of $\gamma = O\left(\kappa\min\left\{\log \frac{f(x^0)-f(x^*)}{\epsilon}, \kappa\right\}\right)$, where $x^*$ is the target solution. We present a new Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding (ARHT) algorithm that makes significant progress on this problem by bringing the bound down to $\gamma=O(\kappa)$, which has been shown to be tight for a general class of algorithms including LASSO, OMP, and IHT. This is achieved without significant sacrifice in the runtime efficiency compared to the fastest known algorithms. We also provide a new analysis of OMP with Replacement (OMPR) for general $f$, under the condition $s &gt; s^* \frac{\kappa^2}{4}$, which yields Compressed Sensing bounds under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). When compared to other Compressed Sensing approaches, it has the advantage of providing a strong tradeoff between the RIP condition and the solution sparsity, while working for any general function $f$ that meets the RIP condition.

> <p>Thompson sampling has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically to enjoy favorable performance in tackling multi-armed bandits problems. Despite its successes, however, one key obstacle to its use in a much broader range of scenarios is the need for perfect samples from posterior distributions at every iteration, which is oftentimes not feasible in practice. We propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method tailored to Thompson sampling to address this issue. We construct a fast converging Langevin algorithm to generate approximate samples with accuracy guarantees. We then leverage novel posterior concentration rates to analyze the statistical risk of the overall Thompson sampling method.  Finally, we specify the necessary hyperparameters and the required computational resources for the MCMC procedure to match the optimal risk. The resulting algorithm enjoys both optimal instance-dependent frequentist regret and appealing computation complexity.</p>

> <p>Consequential decision-making incentivizes individuals to strategically adapt their behavior to the specifics of the decision rule. While a long line of work has viewed strategic adaptation as gaming and sought to mitigate its effects, recent work instead seeks to design classifiers that incentivize individuals to improve a desired quality. Key to both accounts is a cost function that dictates which adaptations are rational to undertake. In this work, we develop a causal framework for strategic adaptation. Our causal perspective clearly distinguishes between gaming and improvement and reveals an important obstacle to incentive design. We prove any procedure for designing classifiers that incentivize improvement must inevitably solve a non-trivial causal inference problem. Moreover, we show a similar result holds for designing cost functions that satisfy the requirements of previous work. With the benefit of hindsight, our results show much of the prior work on strategic classification is causal modeling in disguise.</p>

> <p>In a standard setting of Bayesian optimization (BO), the objective function evaluation is assumed to be highly expensive. Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) accelerates BO by incorporating lower fidelity observations available with a lower sampling cost. In this paper, we focus on the information-based approach, which is a popular and empirically successful approach in BO. For MFBO, however, existing information-based methods are plagued by difficulty in estimating the information gain. We propose an approach based on max-value entropy search (MES), which greatly facilitates computations by considering the entropy of the optimal function value instead of the optimal input point. We show that, in our multi-fidelity MES (MF-MES), most of additional computations, compared with usual MES, is reduced to analytical computations. Although an additional numerical integration is necessary for the information across different fidelities, this is only in one dimensional space, which can be performed efficiently and accurately. Further, we also propose parallelization of MF-MES. Since there exist a variety of different sampling costs, queries typically occur asynchronously in MFBO. We show that similar simple computations can be derived for asynchronous parallel MFBO. We demonstrate effectiveness of our approach by using benchmark datasets and a real-world application to materials science data.</p>

> <p>In many real-world applications, we want to exploit multiple source datasets to build a model for a different but related target dataset. Despite the recent empirical success, most existing research has used ad-hoc methods to combine multiple sources, leading to a gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we develop a finite-sample generalization bound based on domain discrepancy and accordingly propose a theoretically justified optimization procedure. Our algorithm, Domain AggRegation Network (DARN), can automatically and dynamically balance between including more data to increase effective sample size and excluding irrelevant data to avoid negative effects during training. We find that DARN can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives on multiple real-world tasks, including digit/object recognition and sentiment analysis.</p>

> <p>Deep-learning-based methods for different applications have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of such models in safety-critical tasks questionable. Use of deep neural networks as inverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imaging including CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been demonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers, one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the measurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this paper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks. Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max formulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which suppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using the proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In addition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep networks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed approach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS on two different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations on trained networks. We find the behavior for ill-conditioned and well-conditioned measurement matrices to be qualitatively different.</p>

> <p>This paper presents the outsourced-Gaussian process-upper confidence bound (O-GP-UCB) algorithm, which is the first algorithm for privacy-preserving Bayesian optimization (BO) in the outsourced setting with a provable performance guarantee. We consider the outsourced setting where the entity holding the dataset and the entity performing BO are represented by different parties, and the dataset cannot be released non-privately. For example, a hospital holds a dataset of sensitive medical records and outsources the BO task on this dataset to an industrial AI company. The key idea of our approach is to make the BO performance of our algorithm similar to that of non-private GP-UCB run using the original dataset, which is achieved by using a random projection-based transformation that preserves both privacy and the pairwise distances between inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is to show that a regret bound similar to that of the standard GP-UCB algorithm can be established for our O-GP-UCB algorithm. We empirically evaluate the performance of our O-GP-UCB algorithm with synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

> <p>We study the exploration problem with approximate linear action-value functions in episodic reinforcement learning under the notion of low inherent Bellman error, a condition normally employed to show convergence of approximate value iteration. We relate this condition to other common frameworks and show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP assumption of prior work.  We provide an algorithm with a rate optimal regret bound for this setting. While computational tractability questions remain open, this enriches the class of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function where statistically efficient reinforcement learning is possible. </p>

We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods for $SO(3)$ synchronization using both synthetic and real data.

> Unlabeled linear regression, or ``linear regression with an  unknown permutation&#x27;&#x27;,  has attracted increasing  attentions due to its applications in linkage record and de-anonymization.  However, its computation proves to be cumbersome and all existing algorithms require considerable time in the  high dimensional regime.  This paper proposes a one-step estimator which  are optimal from both the computational and statistical  sense.  From the computational perspective, our estimator  exhibits the same order of computational time  as that of the oracle case, where the covariates are known in advance and only the permutation  needs recovery.  From the statistical  perspective, when comparing with the necessary conditions for permutation recovery,  our requirement on \emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\snr$) agrees up to $O\bracket{\log \log n}$ difference  in certain regimes.  Numerical experiments have also been provided to  corroborate the above claims.

> <p>Mixture of linear regressions is a popular learning theoretic model that is used widely to represent heterogeneous data. In the simplest form, this model assumes that the labels are generated from either of two different linear models and mixed together. Recent works of Yin et al. and Krishnamurthy et al., 2019, focus on an experimental design setting of model recovery for this problem. It is assumed that the features can be designed and queried with to obtain their label. When queried, an oracle randomly selects one of the two different sparse linear models and generates a label accordingly. How many such oracle queries are needed to recover both of the models simultaneously? This can also be though of as a generalization of the well-known compressed sensing problem (Cand`es and Tao, 2005, Donoho, 2006). In this work we address this query complexity problem and provide efficient algorithms that improves on the previously best known results. </p>

> <p>To simultaneously capture syntax and global semantics from a text corpus, we propose a new larger-context recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model, which extracts recurrent hierarchical semantic structure via a dynamic deep topic model to guide natural language generation. Moving beyond a conventional RNN-based language model that ignores long-range word dependencies and sentence order, the proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal transitions between sentences and inter-sentence topic dependences. For inference, we develop a hybrid of stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo and recurrent autoencoding variational Bayes. Experimental results on a variety of real-world text corpora demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms larger-context RNN-based language models, but also learns interpretable recurrent multilayer topics and generates diverse sentences and paragraphs that are syntactically correct and semantically coherent.</p>

> <p>High-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics are major challenges when applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding the observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform next-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the decoder) which are discarded during control. In this paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically that explicit next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding. We then use predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics are amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.</p>

> To accelerate kernel methods, we propose a near input sparsity time method for sampling the high-dimensional space implicitly defined by a kernel transformation. Our main contribution is an importance sampling method for subsampling the feature space of a degree $q$ tensoring of data points in almost input sparsity time, improving the recent oblivious sketching of (Ahle et al., 2020) by a factor of $q^{5/2}/\epsilon^2$. This leads to a subspace embedding for the polynomial kernel as well as the Gaussian kernel with a target dimension that is only linearly dependent on the statistical dimension of the kernel and in time which is only linearly dependent on the sparsity of the input dataset. We show how our spectral matrix approximation bounds imply new statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Furthermore, we empirically show that in large-scale regression tasks, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art kernel approximation methods.

  Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Ravindran Kannan [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6335-Metadata.json)
> Recently near-optimal bounds on sample complexity of Mixture of Gaussians was shown in the seminal paper \cite{HSNCAY18}. No such results are known for Ad-mixtures. In this paper we show that $O^*(dk/m)$ samples are sufficient to learn each of $k-$ topic vectors of LDA, a popular Ad-mixture model, with vocabulary size $d$ and $m\in \Omega(1)$ words per document, to any constant error in $L_1$ norm.  This is a corollary of the major contribution of the current paper: the first sample complexity upper bound for the problem (introduced in \cite{BK20}) of learning the vertices of a Latent $k-$ Polytope in ${\bf R}^d$, given perturbed points from it. The bound,  $O^*(dk/\beta)$, is optimal and applies to many stochastic models including LDA, Mixed Membership block Models(MMBM),Dirichlet Simplex Nest,  and large class of Ad-mixtures. The parameter, $\beta$ depends on the probability laws governing individual models and in many cases can be expressed very succintly, e.g. it is equal to the average degree of each node for MMBM, and equal to $m$ in LDA. The tightness is proved by a nearly matching lower of $\Omega^*(dk/\beta)$ by a combinatorial construction based on a code-design. Our upper bound proof combines two novel methods. The first is {\it vertex set certification} which, for any $k-$polytope $K$ gives convex geometry based sufficient conditions for a set of $k$ points from a larger candidate set to be close in Hausdorff distance to the set of $k$ vertices of the polytope. The second is {\it subset averaging} which uses $\beta$ to prove that the set of averages of all large subsets of data is a good candidate set.

> <p>The use of black-box optimization for the design of new biological sequences is an emerging research area with potentially revolutionary impact. The cost and latency of wet-lab experiments requires methods that find good sequences in few experimental rounds of large batches of sequences --- a setting that off-the-shelf black-box optimization methods are ill-equipped to handle. We find that the performance of existing methods varies drastically across optimization tasks, posing a significant obstacle to real-world applications. To improve robustness, we propose population-based optimization (P3BO), which generates batches of sequences by sampling from an ensemble of methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is proportional to the quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to combine the strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness. Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary optimization further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on in-silico optimization tasks, we show that P3BO outperforms any single method in its population, proposing  higher quality sequences as well as more diverse batches. As such, P3BO and Adaptive-P3BO are a crucial step towards deploying ML to real-world sequence design.</p>

> <p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown much empirical success in solving perceptual tasks across various cognitive modalities. While they are only loosely inspired by the biological brain, recent studies report considerable similarities between  representations extracted from task-optimized ANNs and neural populations in the brain. ANNs have subsequently become a popular model class to infer computational principles underlying complex cognitive functions, and in turn, they have also emerged as a natural testbed for applying methods originally developed to probe information in neural populations. In this work, we utilize mean-field theoretic manifold analysis, a recent  technique from computational neuroscience, to analyze the high dimensional geometry of language representations from large-scale contextual embedding models. We explore representations from different model families (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, etc.) and find evidence for emergence of linguistic manifolds across layer depth (e.g., manifolds for part-of-speech and combinatory categorial grammar tags). We further observe that different encoding schemes used to obtain the representations lead to differences in whether these linguistic manifolds emerge in earlier or later layers of the network. In addition, we find that the emergence of linear separability in these manifolds is driven by a combined reduction of manifoldsâ radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.</p>

> <p>The analysis of smooth games has attracted attention, motivated by the success of adversarial formulations. The Hamiltonian method is a lightweight second-order approach that recasts the problem in terms of a minimization objective. Consensus optimization can be seen as a generalization: it mixes a Hamiltonian term with the original game dynamics. This family of Hamiltonian methods has shown promise in literature. However, they come with no guarantees for stochastic games. Classic stochastic extragradient and mirror-prox methods require averaging over a compact domain to achieve convergence. Recent variance-reduced first-order schemes focus on unbounded domains, but stop short of proving last-iterate convergence for bilinear matrix games. We analyze the stochastic Hamiltonian method and a novel variance-reduced variant of it and provide the first set of last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic unbounded bilinear games. More generally, we provide convergence guarantees for a family of stochastic games, notably including some non-convex ones. We supplement our analysis with experiments on a stochastic bilinear game, where our theory is shown to be tight, and simple adversarial machine learning formulations.</p>

> <p>Learning domain-invariant representations is a popular approach to unsupervised domain adaptation, i.e., generalizing from a source domain with labels to an unlabeled target domain. In this work, we aim to better understand and estimate the effect of domain-invariant representations on generalization to the target. In particular, we study the effect of the complexity of the latent, domain-invariant representation, and find that it has a significant influence on the target risk. Based on these findings, we propose a general approach for addressing this complexity tradeoff in neural networks. We also propose a method for estimating how well a model based on domain-invariant representations will perform on the target domain, without having seen any target labels. Applications of our results include model selection, deciding early stopping, and predicting the adaptability of a model between domains.</p>

> <p>Recent advances in maximizing mutual information (MI) between the source and target have demonstrated its effectiveness in text generation. However, previous works paid little attention to modeling the backward network of MI (i.e. dependency from the target to the source), which is crucial to the tightness of the variational information maximization lower bound. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mutual Information (AMI): a text generation framework which is formed as a novel saddle point (min-max) optimization aiming to identify joint interactions between the source and target. Within this framework, the forward and backward networks are able to iteratively promote or demote each other's generated instances by comparing the real and synthetic data distributions. We also develop a latent noise sampling strategy that leverages random variations at the high-level semantic space to enhance the long term dependency in the generation process. Extensive experiments based on different text generation tasks demonstrate that the proposed AMI framework can significantly outperform several strong baselines, and we also show that AMI has potential to lead to a tighter lower bound of maximum mutual information for the variational information maximization problem.</p>

> <p>Model-based reinforcement learning approaches leverage a forward dynamics model to support planning and decision making, which, however, may fail catastrophically if the model is inaccurate. Although there are several existing methods dedicated to combating the model error, the potential of the single forward model is still limited. In this paper, we propose to additionally construct a backward dynamics model to reduce the reliance on accuracy in forward model predictions. We develop a novel method, called Bidirectional Model-based Policy Optimization (BMPO) to utilize both the forward model and backward model to generate short branched rollouts for policy optimization. Furthermore, we theoretically derive a tighter bound of return discrepancy, which shows the superiority of BMPO against the one using merely the forward model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BMPO outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.</p>

  Yi Li, David Woodruff [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6381-Metadata.json) [Supplemental](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6381-Supplemental.zip)
> We give the first input-sparsity time algorithms for the rank-$k$ low rank approximation problem in every Schatten norm. Specifically, for a given $n\times n$ matrix $A$, our algorithm computes $Y,Z\in \R^{n\times k}$, which, with high probability, satisfy $\|A-YZ^T\|_p \leq (1+\eps)\|A-A_k\|_p$, where $\|M\|_p = \left (\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(M)^p \right )^{1/p}$ is the Schatten $p$-norm of a matrix $M$ with singular values $\sigma_1(M), \ldots, \sigma_n(M)$, and where $A_k$ is the best rank-$k$ approximation to $A$. Our algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + n^{\alpha_p}\poly(k/\eps))$, where $\alpha_p = 1$ for $p\in [1,2)$ and $\alpha_p = 1 + (\omega-1)(1-2/p)$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\omega \approx 2.374$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the important case of $p = 1$, which corresponds to the more ``robust&#x27;&#x27; nuclear norm, we obtain $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + n \cdot \poly(k/\epsilon))$ time, which was previously only known for the Frobenius norm $(p = 2)$. Moreover, since $\alpha_p &lt; \omega$ for every $p$, our algorithm has a better dependence on $n$ than that in the singular value decomposition for every $p$. Crucial to our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction for Ky-Fan $p$-norms.

> <p>Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero training error.  Even after memorization, the training loss continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded.  Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, they often fail to maintain a moderate level of training loss, ending up with a too small or too large loss.  We propose a direct solution called \emph{flooding} that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the \emph{flooding level}.  Our approach makes the loss float around the flooding level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flooding level.  This can be implemented with one line of code, and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers.  With flooding, the model will continue to ``random walk'' with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization.  We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of efficiently estimating the effect of an intervention on a single variable using observational samples. Our goal is to give algorithms with polynomial time and sample complexity in a non-parametric setting.</p>  <p>Tian and Pearl (AAAI '02) have exactly characterized the class of causal graphs for which causal effects of atomic interventions can be identified from observational data. We make their result quantitative.  Suppose ð« is a causal model on a set V of n observable variables with respect to a given causal graph G,  and let do(x) be an identifiable intervention on a variable X.  We show that assuming that G has bounded in-degree and bounded c-components and that the observational distribution satisfies a strong positivity condition:</p>  <p>(i) [Evaluation] There is an algorithm that outputs with probability 2/3 an evaluator for a distribution P^ that satisfies TV(P(V | do(x)), P^(V)) &lt; eps using m=O~(n/eps^2) samples from P and O(mn) time. The evaluator can return in O(n) time the probability P^(v) for any assignment v to V.</p>  <p>(ii) [Sampling] There is an algorithm that outputs with probability 2/3 a sampler for a distribution P^ that satisfies TV(P(V | do(x)), P^(V)) &lt; eps using m=O~(n/eps^2) samples from P and O(mn) time. The sampler returns an iid sample from P^ with probability 1-delta in O(n log(1/delta)/eps) time. </p>  <p>We extend our techniques to estimate P(Y | do(x)) for a subset Y of variables of interest. We also show lower bounds for the sample complexity, demonstrating that our sample complexity has optimal dependence on the parameters n and eps as well as the strong positivity parameter.</p>

> <p>Adversarial training augments the training set with perturbations to improve the robust error (over worst-case perturbations), but it often leads to an increase in the standard error (on unperturbed test inputs). Previous explanations for this tradeoff rely on the assumption that no predictor in the hypothesis class has low standard and robust error. In this work, we precisely characterize the effect of augmentation on the standard error in linear regression when the optimal linear predictor has zero standard and robust error. In particular, we show that the standard error could increase even when the augmented perturbations have noiseless observations from the optimal linear predictor. We then prove that the recently proposed robust self-training (RST) estimator improves robust error without sacrificing standard error for noiseless linear regression. Empirically, for neural networks, we find that RST with different adversarial training methods improves both standard and robust error for random and adversarial rotations and adversarial l_infty perturbations in CIFAR-10.</p>

> <p>Solving large complex partial differential equations (PDEs), such as those that arise in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is a computationally expensive process. This has motivated the use of deep learning approaches to approximate the PDE solutions, yet the simulation results predicted from these approaches typically do not generalize well to truly novel scenarios. In this work, we develop a hybrid (graph) neural network that combines a traditional graph convolutional network with an embedded differentiable fluid dynamics simulator inside the network itself. By combining an actual CFD simulator (run on a much coarser resolution representation of the problem) with the graph network, we show that we can both generalize well to new situations and benefit from the substantial speedup of neural network CFD predictions, while also substantially outperforming the coarse CFD simulation alone.</p>

We perform large-scale human studies to investigate the impact of such a pipeline on ImageNet---one of the key datasets driving progress in computer vision. We find that seemingly innocuous design choices (e.g., exact task setup, filtering procedure, annotators employed) can have an unexpected impact on the resulting dataset---including the introduction of spurious correlations that state-of-the-art models exploit. Overall, our results highlight a misalignment between the way we train our models and the task we actually expect them to solve, emphasizing the need for fine-grained evaluation techniques that go beyond average-case accuracy.</p>

> While the impact of variational inference (VI) on posterior inference in a fixed generative model is well-characterized, its role in regularizing a learned generative model when used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) is poorly understood. We study the regularizing effects of variational distributions on learning in generative models from two perspectives. First, we analyze the role that the choice of variational family plays in imparting uniqueness to the learned model by restricting the set of optimal generative models. Second, we study the regularization effect of the variational family on the local geometry of the decoding model. This analysis uncovers the regularizer implicit in the $\beta$-VAE objective, and leads to an approximation consisting of a deterministic autoencoding objective plus analytic regularizers that depend on the Hessian or Jacobian of the decoding model, unifying VAEs with recent heuristics proposed for training regularized autoencoders. We empirically verify these findings, observing that the proposed deterministic objective indeed exhibits similar behavior to the $\beta$-VAE in terms of objective value and sample quality on CelebA and MNIST.

> The best-known and most commonly used technique for distribution-property estimation uses a plug-in estimator, with empirical frequency replacing the underlying distribution. We present novel linear-time-computable estimators that significantly ``amplify&#x27;&#x27; the effective amount of data available. For a large variety of distribution properties including four of the most popular ones and for every underlying distribution, they achieve the accuracy that the empirical-frequency plug-in estimators would attain using a logarithmic-factor more samples. Specifically, for Shannon entropy and a broad class of Lipschitz properties including the $L_1$ distance to a fixed distribution, the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the accuracy attained by the empirical estimators with $n\log n$ samples. For support-size and coverage, the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the performance of empirical frequency with sample size $n$ times the logarithm of the property value. Significantly strengthening the traditional min-max formulation, these results hold not only for the worst distributions, but for each and every underlying distribution. Furthermore, the logarithmic amplification factors are optimal. Experiments on a wide variety of distributions show that the new estimators outperform the previous state-of-the-art estimators designed for each specific property.

> We give strengthened provable guarantees on the performance of widely employed and empirically successful {\sl top-down decision tree learning heuristics}.  While prior works have focused on the realizable setting, we consider the more realistic and challenging {\sl agnostic} setting.  We show that for all monotone functions $f$ and $s\in \N$, these heuristics construct a decision tree  of size $s^{\tilde{O}((\log s)/\eps^2)}$ that achieves error $\le \opt_s + \eps$, where $\opt_s$ denotes the error of the optimal size-$s$ decision tree for $f$.  Previously such a guarantee was not known to be achievable by any algorithm, even one that is not based on top-down heuristics.  We complement our algorithmic guarantee with a near-matching $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$ lower bound.

> <p>Dataset replication is a useful tool for assessing whether models have overfit to a specific validation set or the exact circumstances under which it was generated. In this paper, we highlight the importance of statistical modeling in dataset replication: we present unintuitive yet pervasive ways in which statistical bias, when left unmitigated, can skew results.  Specifically, we examine ImageNet-v2, a replication of the ImageNet dataset that induces a significant drop in model accuracy, presumed to be caused by a benign distribution shift between the datasets. We show, however, that by identifying and accounting for the aforementioned bias, we can explain the vast majority of this accuracy drop. We conclude with concrete recommendations for recognizing and avoiding bias in dataset replication.</p>

> <p>Serving as a crucial factor, the depth of residual networks balances model capacity, performance, and training efficiency. However, depth has been long fixed as a hyper-parameter and needs laborious tuning, due to the lack of theories describing its dynamics. Here, we conduct theoretical analysis on network depth and introduce adaptive residual network training, which gradually increases model depth during training. Specifically, from an ordinary differential equation perspective, we describe the effect of depth growth with embedded errors, characterize the impact of model depth with truncation errors, and derive bounds for them. Illuminated by these derivations, we propose an adaptive training algorithm for residual networks, LipGrow, which automatically increases network depth and accelerates model training. In our experiments, it achieves better or comparable performance while reducing ~50% of training time.</p>

> <p>Increasing model capacity well beyond the point of zero training error has been observed to improve average test accuracy. However, such overparameterized models have been recently shown to obtain low worst-group accuracy --- i.e., low accuracy on atypical groups of test examples --- when there are spurious correlations that hold for the majority of training examples. We show on two image datasets that in contrast to average accuracy, overparameterization hurts worst-group accuracy in the presence of spurious correlations. We replicate this surprising phenomenon in a synthetic example and identify properties of the data distribution that induce the detrimental effect of overparameterization on worst-group accuracy. Our analysis leads us to show that a counter-intuitive approach of subsampling the majority group yields high worst-group accuracy in the overparameterized regime, whereas upweighting the minority does not. Our results suggest that when it comes to achieving high worst-group accuracy, there is a tension between using overparameterized models vs. using all of the training data.</p>

> Learning community structures in graphs that are randomly generated by stochastic block models (SBMs) has received much attention lately. In this paper, we focus on the problem of exactly recovering the communities in a binary symmetric SBM, where a graph of $n$ vertices is partitioned into two equal-sized communities and the vertices are connected with probability $p = \alpha\log(n)/n$ within communities and $q = \beta\log(n)/n$ across communities for some $\alpha&gt;\beta&gt;0$. We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm for solving this problem, which employs the power method with a random starting point in the first-stage and turns to a generalized power method that can identify the communities in a finite number of iterations in the second-stage. It is shown that for any fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{\beta} &gt; \sqrt{2}$, which is known to be the information-theoretical limit for exact recovery, the proposed algorithm exactly identifies the underlying communities in $\tilde{O}(n)$ running time with probability tending to one as $n\rightarrow\infty$. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm with nearly-linear running time that achieves exact recovery at the information-theoretical limit. We also present numerical results of the proposed algorithm to support and complement our theoretical development.

> <p>Multi-kernel learning (MKL) exhibits reliable performance in nonlinear function approximation tasks. Instead of using one kernel, it learns the optimal kernel from a pre-selected dictionary of kernels.  The selection of the dictionary has crucial impact on both the performance and complexity of MKL. Specifically, inclusion of a large number of irrelevant kernels may impair the accuracy, and increase the complexity of MKL algorithms. To enhance the accuracy, and alleviate the computational burden, the present paper develops a novel scheme which actively chooses relevant kernels. The proposed framework models the pruned kernel combination as feedback collected from a graph, that is refined 'on the fly.' Leveraging the random feature approximation, we propose an online scalable multi-kernel learning approach with graph feedback, and prove that the proposed algorithm enjoys sublinear regret. Numerical tests on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel approach.</p>

> <p>We study local SGD (also known as parallel SGD and federated SGD), a natural and frequently used distributed optimization method. Its theoretical foundations are currently lacking and we highlight how all existing error guarantees in the convex setting are dominated by a simple baseline, minibatch SGD. (1) For quadratic objectives we prove that local SGD strictly dominates minibatch SGD and that accelerated local SGD is minmax optimal for quadratics; (2) For general convex objectives we provide the first guarantee that at least \emph{sometimes} improves over minibatch SGD, but our guarantee does not always improve over, nor even match, minibatch SGD; (3) We show that indeed local SGD does \emph{not} dominate minibatch SGD by presenting a lower bound on the performance of local SGD that is worse than the minibatch SGD guarantee.</p>

> Recent papers have demonstrated that ensemble stumps and trees could be vulnerable to small input perturbations, so robustness verification and defense for those models have become an important research problem. However, due to the structure of decision trees, where each node makes decision purely based on one feature value, all the previous works only consider the $\ell_\infty$ norm perturbation. To study robustness with respect to a general $\ell_p$ norm perturbation, one has to consider correlation between perturbations on different features, which has not been handled by previous algorithms. In this paper, we study the robustness verification and defense with respect to general $\ell_p$ norm perturbation for ensemble trees and stumps. For robustness verification, we prove that exact verification is NP-complete for $p\in(0, \infty)$ while polynomial time algorithms exist for $p=0$ or $\infty$. Approximation algorithms based on dynamic programming is then developed for verifying ensemble trees and stumps. For robustness training, we propose the first certified defense method for training ensemble stumps and trees with respect to $\ell_p$ norm perturbations. The effectiveness of proposed algorithms is verified empirically on real datasets.

> <p>We present the first sublinear memory sketch that can be queried to find the nearest neighbors in a dataset. Our online sketching algorithm compresses an N element dataset to a sketch of size O(N^b log^3 N) in O(N^(b+1) log^3 N) time, where b &lt; 1. This sketch can correctly report the nearest neighbors of any query that satisfies a stability condition parameterized by b. We achieve sublinear memory performance on stable queries by combining recent advances in locality sensitive hash (LSH)-based estimators, online kernel density estimation, and compressed sensing. Our theoretical results shed new light on the memory-accuracy tradeoff for nearest neighbor search, and our sketch, which consists entirely of short integer arrays, has a variety of attractive features in practice. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees and present a thorough evaluation of the memory-recall tradeoff of our method on a friend recommendation task in social media networks, including the Google plus graph. We find that RACE provides orders of magnitude better compression than the random projection based alternative while retaining the ability to report the nearest neighbors of practical queries. We expect that our theory will lead to new insight on geometric sketching problems while our methods will enable new possibilities in high-speed data mining and IoT settings. </p>

  Ananya Kumar, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6529-Metadata.json)
> <p>Machine learning systems must adapt to data distributions that evolve over time, in applications ranging from sensor networks and self-driving car perception modules to brain-machine interfaces. We consider gradual domain adaptation, where the goal is to adapt an initial classifier trained on a source domain given only unlabeled data that shifts gradually in distribution towards a target domain. We prove the first non-vacuous upper bound on the error of self-training with gradual shifts, under settings where directly adapting to the target domain can result in unbounded error. The theoretical analysis leads to algorithmic insights, highlighting that regularization and label sharpening are essential even when we have infinite data, and suggesting that self-training works particularly well for shifts with small Wasserstein-infinity distance. Leveraging the gradual shift structure leads to higher accuracies on a rotating MNIST dataset and a realistic Portraits dataset.</p>

> <p>We seek to learn models that support interventions on high-level concepts: would the model predict severe arthritis if it thought there was a bone spur in the x-ray? State-of-the-art models today do not typically support manipulation of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts (provided at training time), and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("bone spurs") and bird attributes ("wing color"). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.</p>

  Rohit Agrawal, Thibaut Horel [Metadata](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6534-Metadata.json)
> <p>The families of f-divergences (e.g. the Kullback-Leibler divergence) and Integral Probability Metrics (e.g. total variation distance or maximum mean discrepancies) are commonly used in optimization and estimation. In this work, we systematically study the relationship between these two families from the perspective of convex duality. Starting from a tight variational representation of the f-divergence, we derive a generalization of the moment generating function, which we show exactly characterizes the best lower bound of the f-divergence as a function of a given IPM. Using this characterization, we obtain new bounds on IPMs defined by classes of unbounded functions, while also recovering in a unified manner well-known results for bounded and subgaussian functions (e.g. Pinsker's inequality and Hoeffding's lemma).</p>

> <p>The reliability of machine learning systems critically assumes that the associations between features and labels remain similar between training and test distributions. However, unmeasured variables, such as confounders, break this assumption---useful correlations between features and labels at training time can become useless or even harmful at test time. For example, high obesity is generally predictive for heart disease, but this relation may not hold for smokers who generally have lower rates of obesity and higher rates of heart disease. We present a framework for making models robust to spurious correlations by leveraging humans' common sense knowledge of causality. Specifically, we use human annotation to augment each training example with a potential unmeasured variable (i.e. an underweight patient with heart disease may be a smoker), which reduces the problem to a covariate shift problem. We then introduce a new distributionally robust optimization objective over unmeasured variables (UV-DRO) to control the worst-case loss over possible test-time shifts. Empirically, we show 5--10% improvements on a digit recognition task confounded by rotation, and 1.5--5% gains on the task of predicting arrests from NYPD Police Stops confounded by location.</p>

> <p>Classical approaches for one-class problems such as one-class SVM (SchÃ¶lkopf et al., 1999) and isolation forest (Liu et al., 2008) require careful feature engineering when applied to structured domains like images. To alleviate this concern, state-of-the-art methods like DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) consider the natural alternative of minimizing a classical one -class loss applied to the learned final layer representations. However, such an approach suffers from the fundamental drawback that a representation that simply collapses all the inputs minimizes the one class loss; heuristics to mitigate collapsed representations provide limited benefits. In this work, we propose Deep Robust One Class Classification (DROCC) method that is robust to such a collapse by training the network to distinguish the training points from their perturbations, generated adversarially. DROCC is motivated by the assumption that the interesting class lies on a locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates DROCCâs effectiveness on two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets across different domainsâimages (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio and timeseries, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection.</p>

> <p>In this paper we present a unified framework based on primal-dual stochastic mirror descent for approximately solving infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) given a generative model. When applied to an average-reward MDP with \A total actions and mixing time bound \tmix our method computes an \eps-optimal policy with an expected \Otil(\tmix^2 \A \eps^{-2}) samples from the state-transition matrix, removing the ergodicity dependence of prior art.  When applied to a \gamma-discounted MDP with A total actions our method computes an  eps-optimal policy with an expected \Otil((1-\gamma)^{-4} \A \eps^{-2}) samples, improving over the best-known primal-dual methods while matching the state-of-the-art up to a (1-\gamma)^{-1} factor. Both methods are model-free, update state values and policy simultaneously, and run in time linear in the number of samples taken.</p>

> <p>Bayesian learning rule is a recently proposed variational inference method, which not only contains many existing learning algorithms as special cases but also enables the design of new algorithms. Unfortunately, when posterior parameters lie in an open constraint set, the rule may not satisfy the constraints and require line-searches which could slow down the algorithm. In this paper, we fix this issue for the positive-definite constraint by proposing an improved rule that naturally handles the constraint. Our modification is obtained using Riemannian gradient methods, and is valid when the approximation attains a block-coordinate natural parameterization (e.g., Gaussian distributions and their mixtures). Our method outperforms existing methods without any significant increase in computation.  Our work makes it easier to apply the learning rule in presence of positive-definite constraints in parameter spaces.</p>

> <p>Recently there have been several attempts to improve the rates of convergence achievable for smooth objectives. In particular, several recent papers have attempted to extend Nesterov's accelerated algorithm to stochastic and variance-reduced optimization. In this paper, we show that there is a simpler approach to obtaining accelerated rates: applying generic, well-known optimistic online learning algorithms and using the online average of their predictions to query the (deterministic or stochastic) first-order optimization oracle at each time step. In particular, we tighten the recent results of Cutkosky (2019) to demonstrate theoretically that online averaging results in a reduced optimization gap, independently of the algorithm involved. Then, we show that a simple tuning of existing generic optimistic online learning algorithms (e.g., Joulani et al [2017]), when combined with the reduced error quantified above, naturally results in optimal accelerated rates. \todoc{what would you consider unnatural? get rid of this word?} Importantly, the smooth objective may or may not be strongly-convex, and the rates are nevertheless optimal for both stochastic and deterministic first-order oracles.  We further show that the same ideas transfer to variance-reduced optimization. In each case, the proofs are much simpler than the previous work, such as the new derivations of accelerated algorithms based on a primal-dual view (Wang and Abernethy, 2018) or the ideas based on linear coupling (Allen-Zhu and Orecchia, 2017). Importantly, we also provide algorithms that maintain the ``universality'' property, meaning that the same algorithm achieves the optimal rate for smooth and non-smooth objectives without further prior knowledge, generalizing the results of Kavis et al (2019) and solving a number of their open problems.</p>

> <p>Neural networks with binary weights are computation-efficient and hardware-friendly, but their training is challenging because it involves a discrete optimization problem. Surprisingly, ignoring the discrete nature of the problem and using gradient-based methods, such as Straight-Through Estimator, still works well in practice. This raises the question: are there principled approaches which justify such methods? In this paper, we propose such an approach using the Bayesian learning rule. The rule, when applied to estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights, results in an algorithm which justifies some of the algorithmic choices made by the previous approaches. The algorithm not only obtains state-of-the-art performance, but also enables uncertainty estimation and continual learning to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides a principled approach for training binary neural networks which also justifies and extends existing approaches. </p>

> <p>We study the problem of high-dimensional robust mean estimation in the presence of a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. A recent line of work has provided sophisticated polynomial-time algorithms for this problem with dimension-independent error guarantees for a range of natural distribution families. In this work, we show that a natural non-convex formulation of the problem can be solved directly by gradient descent. Our approach leverages a novel structural lemma, roughly showing that any approximate stationary point of our non-convex objective gives a near-optimal solution to the underlying robust estimation task. Our work establishes an intriguing connection between algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and non-convex optimization, which may have broader applications to other robust estimation tasks.</p>

> <p>Games are an increasingly useful tool for training and testing learning algorithms. Recent examples include GANs, AlphaZero and the AlphaStar league. However, multi-agent learning can be extremely difficult to predict and control. Even simple games learning dynamics can yield chaotic behavior.  In this paper, we present basic \emph{mechanism design} tools for constructing games with predictable and controllable dynamics. We show that arbitrarily large and complex network games, encoding both cooperation (team play) and competition (zero-sum interaction), exhibit conservation laws when agents use the standard regret-minimizing dynamics known as Follow-the-Regularized-Leader. These laws persist even if different agents use different dynamics and encode long-range correlations between agents' behavior even though the agents may not interact directly. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions under which the dynamics have multiple, linearly independent, conservation laws. Increasing the number of conservation laws results in more predictable dynamics, eventually making chaotic behavior in some cases even formally impossible.</p>

> <p>Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a fundamental problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent can massively improve the sample efficiency of a more complex one. To this end, we propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies into two parts: an independently learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level policy. To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies.</p>

> <p>While deep neural networks achieve great performance on fitting the training distribution, the learned networks are prone to overfitting and are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this regard, a number of mixup based augmentation methods have been recently proposed. However, these approaches mainly focus on creating previously unseen virtual examples and can sometimes provide misleading supervisory signal to the network. To this end, we propose Puzzle Mix, a mixup method for explicitly utilizing the saliency information and the underlying statistics of the natural examples. This leads to an interesting optimization problem alternating between the multi-label objective for optimal mixing mask and saliency discounted optimal transport objective. Our experiments show Puzzle Mix achieves the state of the art generalization and the adversarial robustness results compared to other mixup methods on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets.</p>

> <p>Since hardware resources are limited, the objective of training deep learning models is typically to maximize accuracy subject to the time and memory constraints of training and inference. We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations. This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.</p>

> <p>Although ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide insights for designing networks architectures, its relationship with the non-residual convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is still unclear. In this paper, we present a novel ODE model by adding a damping term. It can be shown that the proposed model can recover both a ResNet and a CNN by adjusting an interpolation coefficient. Therefore, the damped ODE model provides a unified framework for the interpretation of CNNs and ResNets. The Lyapunov analysis reveals better stability of the proposed model, and thus yields robustness improvement of the learned networks. Experiments on a number of image classification benchmarks show that the proposed model substantially improves the accuracy of ResNet and ResNeXt over the perturbed inputs from both stochastic noise and adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the loss landscape analysis demonstrates the improved robustness of our method along the attack direction.</p>

> <p>Machine-learned predictors, although achieving very good results for inputs resembling training data, cannot possibly provide perfect predictions in all situations. Still, decision-making systems that are based on such predictors need not only to benefit from good predictions but also to achieve a decent performance when the predictions are inadequate. In this paper, we propose a prediction setup for Metrical Task Systems (MTS), a broad class of online decision-making problems including, e.g., caching, k-server and convex body chasing. We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms to show how to make the setup robust. We extend our setup in two ways, (1) adapting it beyond MTS to the online matching on the line problem, and (2) specifically for caching, slightly enriching the predictorâs output to achieve an improved dependence on the prediction error. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our methods on real world datasets, which suggests practicality.</p>

> <p>Collaborative machine learning (ML) is an appealing paradigm to build high-quality ML models by training on the aggregated data from many parties. However, these parties are only willing to share their data when given enough incentives, such as a guaranteed fair reward based on their contributions. This motivates the need for measuring a party's contribution and designing an incentive-aware reward scheme accordingly. This paper proposes to value a party's contribution based on Shapley value and information gain on model parameters given its data. Subsequently, we give each party a model as a reward. To formally incentivize the collaboration, we define some desirable properties (e.g., fairness and stability) which are inspired by cooperative game theory but adapted for our model reward that is uniquely freely replicable. Then, we propose a novel model reward scheme to satisfy minimum fairness and trade off between the desirable properties via an adjustable parameter. The value of each party's model reward determined by our scheme is attained by injecting Gaussian noise to the aggregated training data with an optimized noise variance. We empirically demonstrate interesting properties of our scheme and evaluate its performance using synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

> <p>Constant step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent exhibits two phases: a transient phase during which iterates make fast progress towards the optimum, followed by a stationary phase during which iterates oscillate around the optimal point. In this paper, we show that efficiently detecting this transition and appropriately decreasing the step size can lead to fast convergence rates. We analyse the classical statistical test proposed by Pflug (1983), based on the inner product between consecutive stochastic gradients. Even in the simple case where the objective function is quadratic we show that this test cannot lead to an adequate convergence diagnostic. We propose then a novel and simple statistical procedure that accurately detects stationarity and we provide experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-word datasets.</p>

> <p>Normalizing flows  are  exact-likelihood  generative  neural  networks  which  approximately transform  samples from a simple prior distribution to samples of the probability distribution of interest. <br /> Recent work showed that such generative models can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body systems in physics and chemistry.  To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density â in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential â are built into the flow. <br /> We provide a theoretical sufficient criterium showing that the distribution generated by \textit{equivariant} normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design.  Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows preserving symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.</p>

> <p>We develop a novel method, called PoWER-BERT, for improving the inference time of the popular BERT model, while maintaining the accuracy. It works by: a) exploiting redundancy pertaining to word-vectors (intermediate encoder outputs) and eliminating the redundant vectors. b) determining which word-vectors to eliminate by developing a strategy for measuring their significance, based on the self-attention mechanism; c) learning how many word-vectors to eliminate by augmenting the BERT model and the loss function. Experiments on the standard GLUE benchmark shows that PoWER-BERT achieves up to 4.5x reduction in inference time over BERT with &lt; 1% loss in accuracy. We show that PoWER-BERT offers significantly better trade-off between accuracy and inference time compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that our method attains up to 6.8x reduction in inference time with &lt; 1% loss in accuracy when applied over ALBERT, a highly compressed version of BERT.</p>

> <p>With continual miniaturization ever more applications of deep learning can be found in embedded systems, where it is common to encounter data with natural representation in the complex domain. To this end we extend Sparse Variational Dropout to complex-valued neural networks and verify the proposed Bayesian technique by conducting a large numerical study of the performance-compression trade-off of C-valued networks on two tasks: image recognition on MNIST-like and CIFAR10 datasets and music transcription on MusicNet. We replicate the state-of-the-art result by Trabelsi et al. (2018) on MusicNet with a complex-valued network compressed by 50-100x at a small performance penalty.</p>

> The evaluation of robustness against adversarial manipulation of neural networks-based classifiers is mainly tested with empirical attacks as methods for the exact computation, even when available, do not scale to large networks. We propose in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt the $l_p$-norms for $p \in \{1,2,\infty\}$ aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run). It performs better or similar to state-of-the-art attacks which are partially specialized to one $l_p$-norm, and is robust to the phenomenon of gradient obfuscation.

> <p>Many real-world problems require trading off multiple competing objectives. However, these objectives are often in different units with different scales, which can make it challenging for practitioners to express numerical preferences over objectives in their native units. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning that enables setting desired preferences for objectives in a scale-invariant way. We propose to learn a target local policy for each objective, and we use supervised learning to fit a parametric policy to a combination of these distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging high-dimensional real and simulated robotics tasks, and show that setting different preferences in our framework allows us to trace out the space of nondominated solutions.</p>

> <p>We study the problem of learning from multiple untrusted data sources,  a scenario of increasing practical relevance given the recent emergence of crowdsourcing and collaborative learning paradigms. Specifically, we analyze the situation in which a learning system obtains datasets from multiple sources, some of which might be biased or even adversarially perturbed. It is known that in the single-source case, an adversary with the power to corrupt a fixed fraction of the training data can prevent PAC-learnability, that is, even in the limit of infinitely much training data, no learning system can approach the optimal test error. In this work we show that, surprisingly, the same is not true in the multi-source setting, where the adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a fixed fraction of the data sources. Our main results are a generalization bound that provides finite-sample guarantees for this learning setting, as well as corresponding lower bounds. Besides establishing PAC-learnability our results also show that in a cooperative learning setting sharing data with other parties has provable benefits, even if some participants are malicious. </p>

> <p>Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions.</p>  <p>In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.</p>

The key ingredient of our design is a generalization of the  "space-filling'' property of sawtooth functions introduced in (Bailey &amp; Telgarsky, 2018). We elicit the importance of depth  in our construction in driving the Wasserstein distance between the target distribution and its approximation realized by the proposed neural network to zero. Finally, we outline how our construction can be extended to output distributions of arbitrary dimension.</p>

> The field of defense strategies against adversarial attacks has significantly grown over the last years, but progress is hampered as the evaluation of adversarial defenses is often insufficient and thus gives a wrong impression of robustness. Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it difficult to identify the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and  user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to over 40 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than $10\%$, identifying several broken defenses.

> <p>The field of tropical algebra is closely linked with the domain of neural networks with piecewise linear activations, since their output can be described via tropical polynomials in the max-plus semiring.  In this work, we attempt to make use of methods stemming from a form of approximate division of such polynomials, which relies on the approximation of their Newton Polytopes, in order to minimize networks trained for multiclass classification problems. We make theoretical contributions in this domain, by proposing and analyzing methods which seek to reduce the size of such networks. In addition, we make experimental evaluations on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, with our results demonstrating a significant reduction in network size, while retaining adequate performance.</p>

> <p>Deep neural networks have dramatically transformed machine learning, but their memory and energy demands are substantial. The requirements of real biological neural networks are rather modest in comparison, and one feature that might underlie this austerity is their sparse connectivity. In deep learning, trainable sparse networks that perform well on a specific task are usually constructed using label-dependent pruning criteria.  In this article, we introduce Neural Tangent Transfer, a method that instead finds trainable sparse networks in a label-free manner. Specifically, we find sparse networks whose training dynamics, as characterized by the neural tangent kernel, mimic those of dense networks in function space. Finally, we evaluate our label-agnostic approach on several standard classification tasks and show that the resulting sparse networks achieve higher classification performance while converging faster.</p>

> <p>Generally, obtaining theoretical guarantees for neural networks training appears to be a hard problem. Recent research has been focused on studying this problem in the limit of infinite width and two different theories have been developed: mean-field (MF) limit theory and kernel limit theory. We propose a general framework that provides a link between these seemingly distinct limit theories. Our framework out of the box gives rise to a discrete-time MF limit â a setup that to the best of our knowledge was not previously explored in literature.  We prove a convergence theorem for it and show that it provides a more reasonable approximation for finite-width nets compared to NTK limit if learning rates are not very small. Also, our framework suggests a different type of infinite-width limits, not covered by both MF and kernel limit theories. We show that for networks with more than two hidden layers RMSProp training has a non-trivial MF limit, but GD training does not have one. Overall, our framework demonstrates that both MF and NTK limits have considerable limitations in approximating finite-sized neural nets, indicating the need for designing more accurate infinite-width approximations for them.</p>

> <p>According to previous studies, one of the major impediments to accurate off-policy learning is the overestimation bias. This paper investigates a novel way to alleviate the overestimation bias in a continuous control setting. Our method---Truncated Quantile Critics, TQC,---blends three ideas: distributional representation of a critic, truncation of critics prediction, and ensembling of multiple critics. We show that all components are key for the achieved performance. Distributional representation combined with truncation allows for arbitrary granular overestimation control, and ensembling further improves the results of our method. TQC significantly outperforms the current state of the art on all environments from the continuous control benchmark suite, demonstrating 25% improvement on the most challenging Humanoid environment.</p>

> <p>We introduce kernels with random Fourier features in the meta-learning framework for few-shot learning. We propose meta variational random features (MetaVRF) to learn adaptive kernels for the base-learner, which is developed in a latent variable model by treating the random feature basis as the latent variable. We formulate the optimization of MetaVRF as a variational inference problem by deriving an evidence lower bound under the meta-learning framework. To incorporate shared knowledge from related tasks, we propose a context inference of the posterior, which is established by an LSTM architecture. The LSTM-based inference network can effectively integrate the context information of previous tasks with task-specific information, generating informative and adaptive features. The learned MetaVRF can produce kernels of high representational power with a relatively low spectral sampling rate and also enables fast adaptation to new tasks. Experimental results on a variety of few-shot regression and classification tasks demonstrate that MetaVRF delivers much better, or at least competitive, performance compared to existing meta-learning alternatives.</p>

> <p>Existing techniques for certifying robustness of models for discrete data either work only for a small class of models or are general at the expense of efficiency or tightness. Moreover, they do not account for sparsity in the input which, as our findings show, is often essential for obtaining non-trivial guarantees. We propose a model-agnostic certificate based on the randomized smoothing framework which subsumes earlier work and is tight, efficient, and sparsity-aware. Its computational complexity does not depend on the number of discrete categories or the dimension of the input (e.g. the graph size), making it highly scalable. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a wide variety of models, datasets, and tasks -- specifically highlighting its use for Graph Neural Networks. GNNs have become widely used, yet are highly sensitive to adversarial attacks. So far, obtaining provable guarantees has been difficult due to the discrete and non-i.i.d. nature of graph data. Our method can certify any GNN and handles perturbations to both the graph structure and the node attributes.</p>

> <p>Here we present a general framework for learning simulation, and provide a single model implementation that yields state-of-the-art performance across a variety of challenging physical domains, involving fluids, rigid solids, and deformable materials interacting with one another. Our framework---which we term "Graph Network-based Simulators"" (GNS)---represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.</p>

> <p>Highly overparametrized neural networks can display curiously strong generalization performance -- a phenomenon that has recently garnered a wealth of theoretical and empirical research in order to better understand it. In contrast to most previous work, which typically considers the performance as a function of the model size, in this paper we empirically study the generalization performance as the size of the training set varies over multiple orders of magnitude. These systematic experiments lead to some interesting and potentially very useful  observations; perhaps most notably that training on smaller subsets of the data can lead to more reliable model selection decisions whilst simultaneously enjoying smaller computational overheads. Our experiments furthermore allow us to estimate Minimum Description Lengths for common datasets given modern neural network architectures, thereby paving the way for principled model selection taking into account Occams-razor.</p>

> <p>Polygon meshes are an efficient representation of 3D geometry, and are of central importance in computer graphics, robotics and games development. Existing learning-based approaches have avoided the challenges of working with 3D meshes, instead using alternative object representations that are more compatible with neural architectures and training approaches. We present an approach which models the mesh directly, predicting mesh vertices and faces sequentially using a Transformer-based architecture. Our model can condition on a range of inputs, including object classes, voxels, and images, and because the model is fully probabilistic it can produce samples that capture uncertainty in ambiguous scenarios. We show that the model is capable of producing high-quality, usable meshes, and establish log-likelihood benchmarks for the mesh-modelling task.  We also evaluate the conditional models on surface reconstruction metrics against alternative methods, and demonstrate competitive performance despite not training directly on this task. </p>

> <p>Learning novel concepts while preserving prior knowledge is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. The challenge gets greater when a novel task is given with only a few labeled examples, a problem known as incremental few-shot learning. We propose XtarNet, which learns to extract task-adaptive representation (TAR) for facilitating incremental few-shot learning. The method utilizes a backbone network pretrained on a set of base categories while also employing additional modules that are meta-trained across episodes. Given a new task, the novel feature extracted from the meta-trained modules is mixed with the base feature obtained from the pretrained model. The process of combining two different features provides TAR and is also controlled by meta-trained modules. The TAR contains effective information for classifying both novel and base categories. The base and novel classifiers quickly adapt to a given task by utilizing the TAR. Experiments on standard image datasets indicate that XtarNet achieves state-of-the-art incremental few-shot learning performance. The concept of TAR can also be used in conjunction with existing incremental few-shot learning methods; extensive simulation results in fact show that applying TAR enhances the known methods significantly.</p>
